"The song of Muse could get you out of here, but it could also make you drown.",
Read the next life written on the Stone of Life.,
Count the regrets on Naihe Bridge and cross the bridge to reach the other side,
The Darklords are hiding in the Blood Castle within the Crimson Tides.,
Find them and kill them.,
Take pride in being a human.,
Even if you are up against the God!,
The Bifrost that connects Asgard and the world...,
"But now, the Bifrost has been destroyed by the Darkspawns!",
This palace is made out of gold. It was once the residence of Godking Odin. Countless warriors have feasted here...,
Do not let the darkness corrupt this place!,
He who wield this spear shall rule the world.,
-Inscription on the Spear of Eternity,
"The Valkyrie once rode a white horse across the battlefield, seeking the martyrs and bless them with a kiss.",
But she is now blinded by darkness...,
Legend has it that the soul of a true hero will reach Odin's Valhalla when he dies.,
He shall fight in the day and feast in the night. But now...,
The world tree that supports the nine realms collapsed and the fire of despair has torn Asgard apart.,
People are praying. Go help them!,
The ground is shaking and the ocean is boiling. The demons are riding on giant ships made of dead men's nails!,
This is the final moment! For the End of Eternity!,
Facing the absolute darkness and power...,
Resistance is futile!,
"Legend has it that billions of years ago, the sky was torn apart and creatures on earth were devastated. Nuwa patched up the sky with a stone and save the people!",
"But now, Numa is under attack!",
The entrance to 33 planes of existence. An immortal once rode a crane through here. A powerful man once cut into the mountain here.,
But Darkspawns have occupied this place now...,
"This place was once a land of marvel,",
"But now, a monster-infested deadly mountain pass...",
Shennong has tasted a hundred different herbs and taught people about farming and herbal medicine.,

"I can still remember this creek, sheperd boy are resting here with his flock of sheep, farm woman is washing her clothes while singing and the mill uptream is grinding nonstop...  it all!",
But it has been destroyed by darkness!,
The fallen angel dances naked on a floor of feather.,
Her crimson lips are as inviting as a glass of wine... Don't kiss her!,
What's the difference between angels and demons? What's the difference between good and evil?,
Have you ever doubted your beliefs and resolution?,
"Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Eternal life is only granted to those who follow my cause!",
-Unholy Bible Volume XI,
Angels love to make judgments. It doesn't matter if the angel has fallen or not.,
Perhaps they are using judgments to strengthen their teetering faith.,
,
"Travel deep into the abyss without hesitation, they are real warriors!",
"The Sea of Darkness, the Toxic Swamp, the Desolate Land and the Burning Ridge...",
This is not going to be an ordinary journey...,
The fate of a hero is to save a collapsing world.,
Use the flame of light to purify those who became slaves to the darkness!,
"An obscure figure is lurking in the mist, following us like a beast following its prey. It's horrifying...",
"Some people are worse than monsters... In chaotic times, some people are blinded by greed and turn themselves into bandits, taking advantage of the crisis. They must be punished!",
"The monsters bared their teeth, with vile saliva coming out of their mouth. They've cornered a bunch of defenseless women and children.",
We must fight for them!,
The monsters surged in. Seoul is burning and the people in it is screaming and crying...,
Where is Angel's protection? Have we been abandoned by the Angel?,
The monsters are attacking the residence of Angel. The ward of protection is on the brink of destruction and the Angel is in imminent danger...,
No harm shall come to the Angel!,
An even bigger threat is here. The shadow in the mist finally revealed itself...,
We must defeat it!,
A gargantuan barrier stands in the way...,

,
,
,
The first light lingers on...,

,
,
,
Good luck will be with you!,
,
Hold the position!,
No monsters can get through here!,
,
We must protect the world we love!,
Next destination: Rome,
,
,
"Get outta my way, monsters!",
Is there reinforcements?,
,
Human foibles breed monsters...,
,
,
,
The great hero Romulus watches over Rome.,

"Angels battles in rotation in battle, and defeated Angels will not be able to join the battle again. Please arrange your line-up wisely!",
Come on! I shall send you monsters to hell before I die!,
Siren! Let us help you!,
Princess Bari? ! Why are you here? !,
,
,
,
We heard that Tsukuyomi had imprisoned Amaterasu.,
,
"Siren, come with us to defeat Tsukuyomi and save Amaterasu!",
Thank you for your help! I need to clean my wounds first.,
"There's not enough time! Bari, we can do it ourselves!",
,
,
,
,
"Haven't seen you for a long time, Tsukuyomi.",
,
Shut up! A traitor like you has no right to say anything! Where is Amaterasu?,
My sword thirsts for blood!,
"Haha! Swallow them up, my servants!",
,
,
,
I defeated a powerful angel?! Unbelievable!,
Where is Amaterasu? Tell me!,
,
What did you do to Amaterasu?!,
Finally the world will be plunged into eternal darkness!,
"If Amaterasu cannot be awakened, Korea and Japan will be doomed!",
,
,
"Bari, if there are angels in Korea and Japan, there must be angels in Greece! There are so many angels in Greek mythology!",
"Yes! The nightmare angel Nyx! If we get her help, we can awake Amaterasu!",
,
All right.,
,
"The Greek Temple had always been under the protection of the gods. Nyx, the guardian of Athens, defeated the attacking Giant Soulreaver, stripped it of its core, put it into a box, and sent it to Pandora for safekeeping. When Iris handed the box to Pandora as instructed, the curious Pandora couldn't resist the temptation and opened the box...",
Have we arrived in Greece?,
,
,
We should go to Nyx's temple as soon as possible!,
Gabriel! Look out!,
,
New enemies? They're different from monsters we have met before.,
Yes. They are strange.,
We should leave here quickly.,
There's a lamp over there. Let's head that way.,
There's no end to these monsters!,
Wait! It seems that someone is there!,
Let's have a look!,
"Wait a minute, we'll take forever if we keep fighting like this. We need to enhance our power. Well, drastic times call for drastic measures!",
Are you OK? It seems that you are badly hurt!,
,
"Fighting power has risen a lot! Remember, every piece of gear will bring you a qualitative leap!",
"I am Iris, messenger of Gods.",
,
This place is Pandora's Temple.,
Pandora??,
,
"However, Pandora opened it...",
,
We can help you!,
,
"Thank you! Follow me, please.",
We're almost there! That's where Pandora is!,
Go!,
Come on!,
"Thank you, brave Angels! I couldn't have stopped Pandora's rampage without you!",
I told you before not to give the box to Pandora! She's way too curious for her own good!,
,
"Nyx, please awaken Amaterasu from her sleep! Only she can save our country and Japan!",
"Iris had informed me. Don't worry, I will help you. Once you get back, Amaterasu will have awakened!",
,
,
What's going on?! Why is the dark power becoming stronger in Greece?!,
This is because the power of the Sun is weakened! I didn't think it'll come to this!,
"Nyx, what's the meaning of this?",
You need to find Geb right away. She is asking for your help!,
Geb? The God of Earth of Egypt??,
I will send you to help her to put the sun back on track!,
,
WOW! Is this the famous pyramid?! It's so spectacular!,
,
,
Are you reinforcements?,
"Goodness, you startled me!",
Are you Geb? Nyx said that you need our help.,
"Yes, I am. Thank you for coming.",
What happened?,
,
We'll try our best!,
"This is all part of Nephthys' scheme. If you can defeat Nephthys and save Nuit, the sun will rise above the horizon again! Let me take you to the pyramid where Nephthys is in.",
Is this Nephthys' hiding spot?,
,
Huh?! Why?,
,
,
"May you restore the brilliant sun again, and may warm sands guide your path.",
We'll do our best.,
Be careful of the Shadow Servant!,
"None shall pass! Not even you, who wields the power of the Sun God!",
,
Are you pursuing immortality? Give me your heart!,
I shall turn you into grains of the desert sand.,
Nephthys! Take off those dirty bandages! Release Nuit!,
Who are you? Geb! Come out! Let's end it all! Don't get the innocents involved!,
Don't you force our hand!,
You want me to release Nuit? Never!,
"Nephthys, stop it! Release Nuit! The world needs sunlight!",
,
What?!,
,
What do you mean?!,
,
At that exact moment...,
"Hahaha! These cursed bandages are finally broken! My poor and foolish girls, did you really believe that you can stop me with these?",
Geb!!,
"Good Job, idiots! Well done for working so hard to break Nuit's seal! Now, offer up your meager lives and feel the power of Darkness!",
Damn it! You lied to us!!,
Ignorant ants! I am God! Lowly humans cannot understand God's intention!,
You don't deserve being a God! You're a devil!,
Repair my sword and fight to the ninth heaven! Sprinkle my blood and press forward with indomitable will!,
"Well, ants. Prepare to face the power of God!",
,
"Oh, no! Nuit's seal is completely broken! She is going to go on a rampage!",
Isn't there anything we can do?!,
Nuit! My lover! Show them the power of darkness!,
,
,
No! The power of the sun is too strong! No!!,
"Though they managed to stop Nuit's rampage, the Angel was directly exposed to the power of the sun, resulting in her descend to Hell. In order for the Angel to return to the Mortal Realm, she has to obtain permission from the Queen of Hell, Lucifer. Thus, she embark on a long journey to find Lucifer...",
,
Are you finally awake?,
,
"Fortunately, we still possess our Angelic powers. Can you hear me clearly?",
I can hear you... Where am I now?,
,
...Hell... am I dead? !,
Calm down! I am looking for a way to resurrect you right now!,
Then please hurry up!,
Found you...,
Who are you?!,
I am the Guardian Deity of Hell - Minotaur!!,
,
Did you really just say that? You've got guts! You'll make a fine dinner!,
Damned God-killer! Cower in terror against Hells' dominion over you!,
"As long as we keep exploring, monsters will continue to appear, and our Angels will fight to destroy them automatically!",

"Cheonggye, Seoul",
"Please hurry up, my Lady! Or we can't catch the monsters anymore!",
"Monsters won't come to such crowded place like this! The crowd is suffocating me. Bari, I want to go home now.",
"Stop complaining, my Lady! Please remember you are chosed by God. Why don't you have any fighting spirit? !",
"What? I am chosen because of my pretty face, not my fighting spirit.",
Your pretty face?!...,
Look! There are some monsters beside the stage. Let's sneak up on them and wipe them out!,
"Luckily, we didn't come in vain. Let's catch those monsters quickly and go home.",
Look how easy it is! You're up next.,
"Well, looks like the chosen one is itching for a fight, heh heh!",
So easy hahaha!,
I told you that you cannnot summon three Angels at the same time! You will get into trouble!,
Oh! Don't be so excited. I'll pick only one of them now...,
I will go with her! Girls with sword are the sexiest! Haha.,
I will go with her! Girls with arrows are the sexiest! Haha.,
I will go with her! Girls with magic wand are the sexiest! Haha.,
Great! Congratulations my Lady! Today's lesson is over.,
,
Princess Bari is in a good mood. She decides to take a good sleep.,
,
Next night...,
,
,
But I'm just a student traveling to Korea and I have already booked my round-trip ticket for tomorrow.,
Don't bother with those details. Today I'll teach you an important skill: Summon Angels!,
,
WOW! How pretty she is! And she has a pair of REAL WINGS!,
"I told you that will be fun. She is Gabriel, an angel. And she will follow you in the future.",
Follow me? Awesome!,
Yes. She will help you to destroy the monsters!,
,
It's the task God had delegated you. Now let's go and fight alongside Gabriel!,
"Reach over 80% Win Rate to challenge the Boss, beat the Boss, we can go to next Dungeon",
Tap here to edit Angels' <color=#E36853>Line-up</color>,
Gabriel is indeed powerful! It seems effortless for her to destroy all the monsters.,
"Yes! And since you are the master of Gabriel, you are more powerful.",
You will encounter more monsters as you venture down this road. You must vanquish them all!,
Haha! It's so wonderful to have an Angel as a bodyguard!,
,
,
Why do you still remember such a little thing as traveling? You are the one chosen by God!,
,
That's more like it.,
"Bari, look what I just found. It looks very powerful.",
It's the gear dropped from killed monster. Equip it now!,
Here's the key to improving your power! Replace new gears in time when you see a red dot!,
"Sure enough, I feel stronger now.",
Yes. Always remember to change to the newest gear. That's the secret of becoming stronger.,
How easy it is to fight these monsters now!,
,
So many nice things!,
"Yes, there are many rewards for killing the Boss. God won't let you work for nothing.",
"Okay, I see. Is it time to change the gear again?",
Clever! You're definitely the chosen one.,
"With the new gear, I feel I am now stronger than ever!",
"When you see a red dot, you should equip the new gear to become stronger!",
"Yes, my Master.",
Master?? You call me Master?,
Area is cleared! Can we go home and take a rest?,
"It was just a slip of the tongue. I was saying that let's have an early rest today, because we have to go to Japan tomorrow.",
What?! Japan? Why do we suddenly have to go to Japan???! I haven't had a good time in Korea yet.,
"Korea's monsters has been almost eliminated by us. Now, Japan needs you more.",
"Gosh, we need to go to Japan to fight the monsters there?!",
,
It seems that monsters here are much more powerful. I need more help!,
"Well, now we need more advanced angels!!",
What? There are advanced summons? Why don't you say it earlier?,
Advanced Summon comes with higher chances to get high-level angels. Let me show you how to do it~,
"It is dangerous, but at last we killed that bastard!",
This area is safe for the moment. Let's go to other areas to help others.,
"The monster is getting more powerful. If it goes on like this, we will all die here!",
It seems that we need stronger divine power!,
"Have you forgotten these angels? There is enormous divine power hidden in their bodies, which will be released by awakening!",
You should say it earlier. Let's awake them!,
How can it be so easy? We need to find the Angel Shards first. Come with me!,
,
,
"Well, I'll try it right away!",
You have enough Angel Shards and now you can <color=#FCC65AFF>awake</color> the Angel,

God of Present! Take control of everything!,
Great! Is that the power of awakening?,
Go! Let's go on cleaning up the monsters in Japan!,
Sure. I can feel the power surging in her body!,
"Master, Angels can be advanced with the tears of Angel!!!",
,
"Use your heart to feel your connection with Angels, and nurture her with your divine power.",

Oh! You're here!,
God-killer! You actually defeated Nemesis? It seems that the rumor is true!,
,
"Spare my life, please!",
C'mon! Bring it!,
,
"Finally got it, huh! Let me ask you, do you know any way to return to the Mortal Realm?",
,
Where is Muse? Tell me!,
"Well, I can tell you. But first, you have to defeat these monsters!",
This Canyon is Medusa's territory! It's quite dangerous!,
Medusa?,
A monster who has human's head and snake's body. Those who looked into hers eyes would turn to stone!,
Turn to stone?!,
"If you don't believe it, you can have a try. Anyway, I will not enter the canyon. If you can live after passing through the canyon, you can see a forest shrouded in mist at the end of canyon, where you can hear songs.",
Songs??,
Follow the song and you'll find Muse. Good luck! I'll be taking my leave now!,
Who broke into my territory?,
,
~~~(Singing sound),
Muse!,
"Hi, are you Muse?!",
~~~!! ~~~!!~~~!!(A sudden sharp voice),
Muse!!!,
Who is it? How dare you interrupt me! Who?!!,
,
,
,
Do you know how to escape from hell?,
,
Lucifer? Where can I find her?,
,
When's that going to happen? I want to see her now!,
,
...,
,
My gosh!!!,
"Lalala~~~, please tell me~~~, where can we find Lucifer~~~",
,
,
"The fallen Dark Goddesses~~~stole Lucifer's artifact [Black Bow], and they intended to use [Black Bow] to destroy the earth~~~!",
"Lucifer was so angry~~~ If you can take the Black Bow back, I think she will be glad to see you~~~",
Dark Goddesses? Where are these evil goddesses?,
,
Thank you~~~ my dear Muse~~~,
,
Nemesis: Soon! Finally!,
"Once the bowstring is pulled, the new world of darkness will come!",
No way! In your dreams!,
Oh? A human? Here?,
Aren't you the bug that always gets in the way? Welcome to Hell!,
I will never allow you to do this with Black Bow!,
"Haha! You, and your world! Sink into hell forever!",
"Pull the bowstring, quickly!",
"Ah, Lucifer!",
"Oh, so this is where you all are.",
I never dreamt that I'd see you all fighting at the edge of Hell.,
Lucifer~,
"Lilith and Nemesis, do you want to use my bow to destroy the earth?",
,
She's so annoying! To think she's still saying such things even when shes' dying!,
,
,
,
Close your eyes. We're about to set out!,
,
I'm so happy to see you again!,
Oh! It's great to come back to the earth!,
"In any case, I'm very happy.",
Where is this? Why is everything in ruins?,
"Oh, you've come! I am Odin! Your Angelic deeds have been widely circulated! To obtain your help, I've asked Lucifer to send you here.",
The fallen Dark Goddesses Nemesis and Lilith want to destroy the world!,
"Obviously they have already started. You were attacked in hell, after all.",
What can we do?,
You were once bathed in sun's divine light. It was that light that made you burn and fall into hell.I need you to pour the sun's divine light into the Eternity Spear to awaken the spear spirit!,
How do I do that? Do I just hold the spear?,
No! Only those who have passed the Fate Trials can touch the Eternity Spear!,
Fate Trials?!,
"You have passed the Fate Trials and the Eternity Spear has reawakened! Congratulations, Odin!",
Haha! Give me Eternity Spear!,
"Sif?! Daughter of Odin, what are you doing?!",
What happened?!,
This day has finally come! The Eternity Spear is mine!,
,
Betray you? I've never been loyal to you!,
"Idun! Now Asgard also belongs to us, right?",
Haha! That's right! We can use this spear to conquer the world!,
,
Who seduced you to fall into degeneration? Tell me and I'll let you two live!,
,
,
Tell me quickly! Who!,
,
,
We are Goddesses! We're not babysitters to those foolish and evil humans! You should have given them up! You are the one who betrayed us!,
I will never let you all get away with this!,
"Valkyrie, I will not forgive you, never!",
"Haha! Where is the powerful queen of Asgard, Odin? Why are you so weak now?",
,
"Yes, she trusted me. So what? Now Asgard is mine! I will rule the world! Time for you to join Odin in Hell!",
,
"For Odin! Valkyrie, I swear that I will kill you one day!",
"Then do try your very best. I'll be waiting for you while sitting on the throne of Asgard! Now, I have other urgent matters to attend to, so I won't be wasting more time entertaining you. Haha!",
"I need your help! Please, protect Asgard!",
,
Watch your step! Asgard is collapsing! Be careful!,
Ahh!,
,
,
,
What?!!!,
,
"Asgard was collapsing. In the critical moments, the Creation Goddess Nuwa saved Angel. From Nuwa, she knew that only Xuanyuan Sacred Sword could completely eradicate Erebus. For this reason, Angels walked into the vast Kunlun Mountains and embarked on a sword-seeking journey.",
Ahhh!,
You're awake.,
,
I am Nuwa and here is my shrine. I saw you fall from Throat of World and then saved you.,
,
"Nuwa, could you please repeat what you said to me?",
What?,
"At the beginning of the creation, the Goddesses were divided into two polarities: one was the Light, and the other was Darkness. With both Light and Darkness in balance, all in existence flourishes. Until one day, humans began to question the authority of the Goddesses...",
,
"Now only you can stop Erebus, daughter of fate!",
,
There is a way. That is to find Xuanyuan Sacred Sword which sealed Erebus in the past!,
Where is the Xuanyuan Sword?,
,
,
,
,
"I will kill those who has invaded my territory, no matter how far they go!",
,
"Taiji generates two complementary forces, and two complementary forces generate four aggregates. Then the four aggregates generate eight trigrams!",
Is this the Eight-Trigram Array?,
Are you ready to enter the Realm of Fire?,
,
Who is that?! How impertinent!,
,
Go to hell!,
Ha-ha~,
"Nuwa, I've found the Xuanyuan Sword!",
"Well done! Now listen, you don't have enough power to control the sword at your present state. From what I can see, you can only use it once, so you must seize a good opportunity to strike a deadly blow to Erebus!",
Quick! Use the Xuanyuan Sword now!,
Quick!,
I can't control it! Ahhhh!!,
The Xuanyuan Sword missed! Erebus escaped!,
,
Erebus escaped! Let's chase after her!,
,
Are you ok? Have you been injured?,
,
Take a rest here. I'll follow Erebus!,
,
"Protected by fallen Angel guards, Erebus entered the Canyon of Fallen Goddesses!",
You've worked hard. Let's go!,
How are you?,
,
(My power fluctuates strangely ... as if mixed with other things...),
,
Dirty human being! I will purify your soul!,
Cut the crap.,
"Human, accept the judgment of fate!",
The guilty one is you!,
Listen to the horn of death! Give up the unnecessary struggle!,
You are not worthy to be called Goddesses!,
Archangel Michael!! Let's put an end to this! Where is Erebus?,
Despicable human beings cannot enter the realm of Goddess! Go away!,
Goddesses? You call yourselves goddesses?! You are fallen devils!,
"How dare humans talk about degeneration?! All this is because of you! You are foolish, greedy, shameless and evil! Only darkness can completely purify the world! Only then can we create a new kingdom of goddesses! No humans in it!",
But humans are created by you! Humans are your people!,
This is our only stain! Only by eradicating humans can the world be innocent again!,
,
Where is Erebus?,
Erebus has returned to her mother's side. You cannot stop her!,
,
"Gaia, Mother of Gods?",
,
What should we do?,
Go to where Gaia is.,
Where's that?,
,
"Stop! Erebus, she is your mother!",
"Only humans care about the so-called family affection, and that's why you can not become eternal Gods!",
Watch out!! Erebus has absorbed all Gaia's energy!,
Let's put an end to this!,
,
,
,
No! What's happening?! Pull yourself together! No!,
"Erebus released a dark energy, eroding the Angel's soul, and the dark demoness Lilith was reborn in the Angel's spiritual world. Meanwhile, the seven deadly sins in her consciousness, 'Pride', 'Envy', 'Wrath', 'Sloth', 'Greed', 'Gluttony', and 'Lust' are infinitely magnified. Can the Angel defeat herself?",
,
It's time to get up~,
,
Haha! Thank you for remembering me!,
Aren't you already...?,
Dead? Death is just a concept of human world. Goddesses will not die! We are eternal beings! Death? We just temporarily hide our traces from the physical world.,
,
"Everything is over? Says who? Haha, look at yourself! Stop hiding and be true to yourself!",

Why so desolate?,
The front seems full of danger.,

These monsters seem to have the power of God!,
They are fallen gods!,
Finally beat them!,
A black mist came over!,
I don't seem to be able to control myself!,
Who is helping me?,
"The last god, where did the other gods go?",
God is also eroded by evil thoughts.,
"Through trials, I can inherit the power of God!",
"I will stick to it, never give up!",
So close!,
Target Demon Realm!,
"It's really hot, it's getting burnt!",
What a huge volcano!,
Damn! So many monsters!,
Rushed and arrived!,
What are these beautiful young ladies?,
Beauty often coexists with danger.,
"Come on, let the flames be more intense!",
Toasted dog meat tonight!,
,
But I never give up!,
,
The light of victory is here!,
There is a weird old man in front.,
How come you come back here?,
"The entrance to the demon world,like the eyes of a demon!",
The light of hope never dissipate!,

WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_1,"Judgement Day's horn has been sounded. Gabriel, the one true Seraphim, descends to destroy all that is wicked on the Mortal Realm."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_2,"Humans are just prey for Lilith. The stronger the humans, the more excited she feels when preying on them."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_3,Nephthys has double wings and also likes to become birds such as falcons and eagles. She can save people from danger and she can also lead people to death.
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_4,"Nyx is a god that symbolizes concepts such as sky, daylight, dream, death, sleep, fate, pain, aging, toil, age, and decay."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_5,Iris sends messages between the gods and creatures. She always leaves a rainbow in the sky when she flies across to guide souls of those women to rest in peace.
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_6,People should not have too much good fortune. Nemesis will curse those blessed people and plunge people into endless suffering.
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_7,No one can look straight into Medusa's eyes. Such a powerful yet tragic ability has created the powerful and terrifying Medusa.
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_8,"Danger is always hidden behind her beautiful face and singing. The sea, full of deadly temptation, has long been piled with bones."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_9,"Fuxi is the head of the three emperors and the hundred kings. She not only possesses the power of gods, but also is a wise thinker and inventor."

WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_12,"Instead of becoming a slave in Heaven, Lucifer would rather be the king in Hell. She has strong will, desire for revenge and unquenchable hatred."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_13,"She owns a lightning spear, a trident, a bident, and a sun carriage. Be it violence or art, she is perfectly capable of it."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_14,"There is endless darkness between the earth and the underworld. When you look into such an abyss, Erebus is also staring at you."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_15,"Nuwa -- an ancient goddess, is the creator of everything. She has the independent godhead of the creation god and primordial god. She is worshipped by hundreds of millions of people."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_16,"Hades loves the dark underworld. She always holds a bident with the three-headed dog Cerberus, waiting for the next arrival of the underworld."
WORLD_BOSS_SHOWTEXT_17,"Odin is the king of gods, a title that is enough to awe most weak people. She holds the Spear of Eternity which is a magical weapon. All of her enemies have no hope to defeat her."

"The flowers and the fruits are small. Myth Peach were riped for three thousand years, when people ate them, they will become immortals and their body will be be light; \n Myth Peach were riped for six thousand years, when people ate them will be soaring and living forever; \n Myth Peach were riped in nine thousand years, when people ate them, their lives will be as long as the world living.",
"Iris as the meaning of the throne provided the throne to pharaoh who is Iris' child. Iris can use her throne to protect young children and dead people,  also she can also use her throne to resurrect the dead.",

"Phantasos knew every skill and she can transform into the appearance of everything in the world. No one has ever seen the original appearance of Phantasos, maybe she has forgotten what she was originally.",
Don't approach the good night in the night and fall asleep in such a comfortable song to avoid falling into their mouths.,
"Through the beautiful eyes, I saw you and Medusa are in the journey. \nIt is beautiful and pure. It likes an unattainable dream, but it makes you willing to pursue it until your body and soul slowly petrify.",

"Sins turn into silk threads and gradually wrap around you. You cannot breathe. Your body and soul will die unless the silks are cut through by Nemesis.\nEven in her merciless justice, death is inevitable as she cuts through the silks, down into your very soul.",
"The sun, moon and stars all perish and regenerate under her dome. Hundreds of millions of lives on the earth are sheltering the reincarnation of the next generation.",
Jeanne d'Arc met an angel under the big tree behind the village and received 'God's revelation'. She raised the rebellious war flag and led her generals to win the war. This flag followed her in the battle on the front lines of the war but was never broken. The oracles from flag often helped Jeanne d'Arc.,

"The baby in the swaddle was abandoned and life shouldn't have been so damaged. \nThe magpie was flying to guard and the golden tortoise swam into the sea with the baby on its back.

We can't detect her guilt through her beautiful face from a fallen angel. \nUntil she spread her Pride Wings.,

"Under the uncanny work of nature, this Starfire Stone has continued the Chinese civilization.\nLie down in the jungle and mountains when calm, and burst into starlight sparks when fierce. \nIt is both a continuation of civilization and a dangerous terminator.",
"Simple and powerful-the truth of the world is also summed up by this sentence. \nMake your oath to Gangnir, never regret it and the oath will be fulfilled. You can use them to enemies when you are in fight.. \nWhen you are using it, it is like a meteor piercing the sky. It will penetrate everything even the Holy Sword Gram cannot escape this disaster.",
"The nether god Erebus is the embodiment of eternal darkness, and she uses her Nether Shawl to block the world and the underworld. \nNo trace of light can pass through the Nether Shawl  to reach the territory of Erebus, she is staying in darkness forever.",
"Standing on the solid ground and surrouned by the hustle and bustle of the city, everyone is busy living their own life and worries about trivial things. \nBut the vastness of the universe humbles us. We all live under the eye of Gaia and we exist in this chaotic universe only because of Gaia's love for us.",

Your have such a sensitive nose...,
Errr... I didn't bring it!,
Not the cute one!,
A little...,
It refers to friend.,
It refers to lover.,
Yes! I want to touch!,
"Humph, I don't want to.",
Exactly...,
"Yes, you are very strong!",
How do you feel about yourself?,
Do you want to regain power?,
Maybe this is destiny...,
I am very good at surfing!,
"Eh, I will be drowning in water.",
I will end it as soon as possible!,
"It's my favorite, too.",
It feels a bit ordinary...,
I think so.,
"No, I don't.",
I will always support you.,
Feeling sorry for them can't change anything.,
This disaster must have an end.,
I see you as a companion.,
Thoughts of family come to mind when I think of you.,
I believe so.,
"No, the gods don't care about us.",
Do you have many companions?,
How about summoning it again?,
But you responded to the summon.,
You are so innocent...,
Do all bulls have such a good memory...,
Just call me the commander!,
"Undoubtedly, you are stronger.",
"Uh, I don't want to answer...",
"Wow, is that true?",
I think it isn't that...,
Good answer! Doesn't love appear precious because of many hardships?,
"Your tone makes you sound bitter and jaded. There's no need for that. With me at your side, your luck with love will be much better.",
"Right? After all, if gods are so different from humans that they can't share a deep love with them, I would rather not be a god!",
"... After all, humans have short lifespans. And, sadly, their love dies with them.",
"If you don't tell me who it is, then I'll write your name on an arrow and shoot it out blindly! Do you really want to leave it up to chance?",
So which lucky girl will my arrow of love strike? Wait... This arrow seems to be targeting me?!,
I make it my mission to ruin love rooted in greed. Will you stay at my side and help?,
"You know its true love when you're willing to give up everything for it, including the power to rule the world.",
Really? That's great! I'm a bit tired of being the god of love and need a break. I'm looking for someone to take my place for a while,
"Do you want me to give you private lessons? Just grab my hand and draw back the bowstring. ...Oh, why is your other hand touching me there?",
I wasn't expecting you to ask me so suddenly! I don't know what to say...,
"Anyone would be fine... Although, a date with you would be nice.",
"That's just the way it is! No matter how pleasant your words are, I won't be happy with the praise from mortals!",
"You are different from those who love flowers with beautiful colors, which surprised me a lot..",
It seems that you are a person who does not believe in fate. It has been a long time since no mortal dared to fight against fate.,
"For your sake, you better hope that person isn't you. Whoever I marry will suffer horribly.",
There's no one else here. Just relax and enjoy this time alone together.,
"Although there are only two of us! But this is just a personal invitation, don't think too much!",
"I'm never soft on the battlefield. But if you want me to treat the enemy with kindness, I won't object.",
Haha... Many people have already said this to me and followed me onto the battlefield. Would you like to know their stories?,
What are you talking about! I don't... don't care if a mortal admires me!,
"Haha...Yes, what this world prizes power. Would you help me regain some of my power by serving as my sword and shield?",
You are different from everyone else! You are the only one I have ever admired. That is why I have chosen you and only you.,
"The gods are always fighting amongst themselves. Yet, I'm astounded that you have managed to unite even opposing gods under one banner.",
You're right. I will continue trying to overcome my fear.,
Whether or not I can fly doesn't matter. Seeing you gives me courage.,
"I think so, too. When heroes know they might fall in battle, it can fill them with fear.",
"Yes, sometimes that is true. But such recklessness comes at a heavy cost.",
"Unfortunately, my bravery precludes such wisdom, for I rarely think things through. I am often blinded by my confidence.",
"Some things grow more confusing the more you think about them. Regardless, it is still good to ponder such things.",
"Therefore, a good artist should also be a good inventor. I always dream to be such a person!",
My artificial wings are a spectacularly beautiful invention! Aren't they the perfect example of artistic invention?,
"My sculptures are a private affair since they are all body art based on myself. But for you, I'll make an exception.",
"Sculpture is best learned on your own, though I would be happy to be your model!",
Not necessarily. I have seen many human heroes in Greece. They are fully strong enough to compete with gods on the battlefield!,
"There are many monsters and demons whose lifespans are nearly eternal, but they don't seem to be gods either.",
I'm pleased that you enjoy that season. The cold often brings an icy calm to the land.,
"People often associate cold with death. However, snow and ice are part of the world, and they are eternal.",
"Many great human heroes have faced like this. They are surrounded by countless glory, but they are never understood by others.",
"I never thought I would be interested in a human being, but the days with you seem to be quite interesting.",
"Fortunately you think so. What the world needs is rationality and order, not chaos and destruction.",
But most of the reasons are unreasonable. I hope you can calmly think about the meaning of every battle like me.,
"She is the worst-tempered of our three sisters. She is very anxious but enthusiastic and refreshing, and she has a good relationship with humans.",
"She has the brightest mind of our three sisters. There have been many bounty hunters to fight against her, but none of them have come back...",
"The method is very simple. Freeze yourself, then you can have eternal youth like me. Isn't this wonderful?",
"Wise decision. Mankind may be able to obtain eternal life, but it may pay a greater price for it...",
Strange guy... Maybe this is why I am willing to open my heart in front of you...,
"I don't know...but so far, no one will accompany me like you all the time...",
"Oh! So direct! ...But yes, it would be a date. I hope to share a lovely evening with you. We could make many pleasant memories.",
Hmm... let me guess... You already have plans with another girl?,
"Since I created the world, I haven't seen many humans tell the truth. It's a pity.",
Oh really? So... I love you. But is that the truth or a lie? Take a guess.,
"I envy humans for the time they spend in the afternoon sun, whether it be shopping, sunbathing, or strolling through the park with a lover.",
The night is full of mystery. It is the perfect time for two lovers to be alone... Anyway... Are you free tonight?,
"Oh, really? Then we'll see if your kindness can save us from the disaster that's engulfed the world.",
That's pleasing to hear. I prefer strong individuals.,
"If you follow your instincts, what sort of trouble will the two of us get into tonight when we're alone in our room?",
"You may be calm and rational now, but we'll see how long that lasts in the presence of my seductive charm.",
"Not surprising. The world is already full of tragedy. ...And speaking of tragedies, I hope you can stop the disaster that's engulfing the world today.",
I'm shocked! Just don't watch too many of them. I don't want them to make you pessimistic.,
"From now on I will miss the moon that we saw today, and I hope you will not forget today's promise...",
You don't need to answer me so quickly. I will wait until you complete your mission.,
"Thank you for your trust in me all the time, and I will protect your back on the deadly battlefield.",
Then at least allow me to pray to the moon for your safety every night before the war is over.,
They like to get close to humans very much. They are so lovable guys...,
"Hmm... With your personality, you might prefer some fierce and wild guys, right?",
"After this war is over, let's go back to my hometown together, where there will never be apocalypse and disaster.",
"I understand that you are in this world, maybe there are things you can never give up...",
I should be grateful for meeting you. Maybe this is the greatest comfort that fate has given a lonely person.,
Mortal people sigh for the short life. How can they understand the eternal loneliness...,
"Then lie down on my lap, close your eyes and listen quietly. Wish you a good night...",
"Well, if it were you, I would be happy to listen.",
"Well, next time show me your bravery on the battlefield.",
Only those who have had their homeland invaded would understand.,
You are very reassuring.,
"So far, I have never let my Nordic companions down.",
,
"Then, what about you? Who do you want to protect?",
I swear... Never let this happen again in this world.,
"Well, that's ok, you don't want to know how tragic the disaster was...",
I wasn't worried. I was just... pointing it out.,
"If you don't have my protection next time, then don't take risks like that again!",
What do you mean... Are you willing to regain my strength with me?,
You fool...,
You remind me of my youth. It was nice to reminisce on ages past.,
I'm glad you're not short-tempered like me. Maybe you're a more suitable commander than I am.,
"Therefore, as long as human beings continuously hone themselves, one day they will be able to reach the mighty state of gods!",
"When it comes to eternal life, humans can achieve it either through prayer or magic. Just look at me! I'm the perfect example.",
"It is worth dying on the battlefield for your own ideas and values. After all, isn't the greatest joy in life to think and act as one pleases?",
"I hope you can also find the meaning and value of your life on the battlefield, and fight for your own ideas!",
"It's not weird to me either. It's the meaning behind it that's important. A miko must not only be wise and reverent, but she must also have the will of a samurai!",
You won't think it strange when I prove to you on the battlefield that I am also a qualified warrior with an indomitable will!,
I knew I could trust you! I look forward to seeing your talent and courage as a ruler!,
"If anyone else said this, I would never agree. I don't know why, but I always think you're right.",
"Good, because even the most feminine woman can have a strong and commanding side to her personality!",
"When I'm with you, I worry about it more than I should admit.",
"Unlike most humans, you are more rational than I thought, and maybe it is a correct decision to cooperate with you.",
Really? You are the 147th human to say this. Guess the fate of the last 146 guys?,
"I am very pleased to hear that you agree with my point of view, maybe you really have the ability to become the leader of the gods.",
"Anger will only make your head hot, but if you can control your own anger, you may also have powerful power.",
"In a way, you are right. After defeating the group of idiots who came to crusade against me, my strength has indeed improved a lot.",
So how long will it take you to end this world war between the gods?,
"It's not a good thing for this grumpy guy to wake up. Surprisingly, she gets along well with humans...",
"If you're fine, don't mess with her. If she is in a bad mood, you may be frozen in ice for the rest of your life...",
"God also has birth and destruction, and he also needs to follow the rules of the world. God is not the truth, but just a strong existence.",
"In my opinion, only those who want to become gods would say this. It seems that you are also an ambitious guy...",
"In addition to competitors. I am looking forward to the relationship with you in the future, that... a deeper relationship can also be...",
"You are too slow! We have been working together for so long, haven't you noticed it...",
"no problem! This time I won't be like the last time, because I lost to you carelessly!",
Is it finally my turn to play? ! Wait to see me burn the enemy into a barbecue! Hahaha!,
Do I look like a merciful person? ! Nothing excites me more than defeating an enemy!,
"Even if it is a monster, it must be given a chance to solve the problem peacefully, although it is useless most of the time.",
"As your companion, I am very happy to hear you, the commander-in-chief, agree with me, hum...",
"It's no surprise that when I stepped onto the battlefield of this world, I had no longer any nostalgia for life.",
"She is a wise and strategic guy, but if you really want to fight, she will definitely not be able to beat me!",
"That cold guy is so boring, I can't stay by her side for a second!",
"Therefore, as the commander of the gods, you must have courage stronger than them!",
"Thinking too complicated is meaningless. Without courage, how do you face the difficulties and fears on the way to becoming a god?",
Didn't expect it? ! My craftsmanship is not inferior to your top human chefs!,
"Hmm... let me think... I like most of the dishes, but of course, the roast meats are my favorite! !",
"Indeed. Self-blame has no significance. As a symbol of light and hope, I need to cheer up again!",
"You are right...Even if you were once the ruler of the sun, you still need to face the end of the world with your companions.",
"Sorry, I seem to be over-indulged in the passing time. I hope it didn't bother you.",
"As you said, people expect to find a peaceful life like in the past, so we must end this disaster!",
"Anyway, I always believe that differences in ideas can be unified in a more peaceful way, not war.",
"I can understand the dilemma that needs to be resolved immediately in a crisis, but I still hope that you treat every war with caution.",
"At that time, the Yamato gods will take the responsibility of maintaining peace, so the re will be no disputes anymore.",
But I will definitely complete this mission. Do you feel it? That's why destiny made me come to this world.,
"Although I live in a different era from you, I am very confident in my skills in spinning and designing clothes!",
"Although when I measure your height and measurements, you need to be frank with me, I think our relationship should be fine for that...",
"Haha, when a person feels no fear of death, he will no longer have any weaknesses. You will soon understand...",
You are the most rational mortal I have ever met. Our future cooperation may become more interesting...,
"Therefore, no matter it is mortal or gods, they should follow fate while they are alive and prepare for death...",
"Oh, really? I would like to see if you, as the spokesperson of death, can escape from me...",
"A wise answer. A strategy is just a strategy, to differ them as good or evil is just a kind of rhetoric and excuse.",
It seems that you are different from me. You are more willing to use your fists and strength to resolve conflicts... Should I praise your sense of glory?,
"You are right, but unfortunately, this sentence is only valid when the strong man is alive...",
"Oh, it's hard to believe that I would hear this from mortals. That's right, you will find that death is the fairest rule in the world.",
Yes...see how many heroes lost their lives for glory. Death in this way is also an art...,
"Death will erase everything. Whatever how great the glory was made by the hero, it will fade away with the passing of admirers...",
Look at your reaction...do you think that the biggest regret in life is the lack of a girl's company?,
"Well, look at the girls around you, see how they admire you. You really have no regrets in your life.",
"With your strong power, you will return from any dangerous place. Of course, it is another matter of which way you come back, whether it is standing or lying down...",
"Hmm... you'd better put on the thickest armor before you leave, otherwise I don't guarantee that you will come back completely...",
"You made a sensible choice! When you go on my trial after you die, I promise you will know more...",
"Don't worry, it's much more fun than you think...especially when you kick the nasty guy down the abyss...",
I don't feel repulsion for war. The dead people caused by war can make my lonely palace bustling for months...,
"Well, let's make a bet and see if this doomsday can end with the war you lead.",
"Uh-hum, are you free tonight? Are you interested in experiencing the charming side of the god of death in my room?",
It really disappoints me. It seems that I need to punish you tonight who doesn't understand the romance...,
"Nature does sometimes bring disasters, but this is a destiny directed by heaven, not a man-made disaster.",
"Although you often fight on the battlefield, I know that everything you do is to end the war as soon as possible.",
I hope you don't get too impatient when you get along with girls. Girls get angry even more terrible than the heaven cracks...,
"Oh, is it? Then you must be very good at chasing girls. It takes a lot of patience to get along with girls...",
"I am very pleased that you can agree. Everything has a destiny, and nature controls them all the time.",
"I certainly don't think other people can succeed, but if it is you... maybe there is a small possibility.",
"I appreciate your kindness, but there is no need to do so, because this is the destiny that nature wants me to face.",
Haha... No mortal has ever said something like this to me...Do you know what it means?,
"Believe me, after experiencing countless adventures and excitement, you will feel that dull life is a kind of enjoyment.",
Do you think so too?! Would you be interested in coming to my garden tonight to see the potted plants I plant?,
"Humph... Hope you can really have this consciousness. After all, justice requires extraordinary courage.",
"Courage comes from your consciousness. When your consciousness is unassailable, nothing can stop you on the battlefield.",
"I can send you to heaven right now, but there is no return. Do you want to have a try?",
"I don't know, but judging from the screams from the sulfur fiery pits of hell every day, it should be a very exciting place.",
Do you think it is really the devil who destroys this world? Or it is the evil thoughts hidden in the hearts of people or gods?,
"I don't know either, but I'd rather say that I hope you can solve this problem one day.",
"Are you kidding me? ! If it is true, I must give you a few punches to confirm that you are not dreaming!",
"I would be happy to find a choir to sing hymns to her every day for hundreds of years, until she can't stand then pleads guilty and repents.",
"As a commander of the gods, courage and rationality are all needed, but rationality is the prerequisite for all correct judgments!",
What... what are you going to do? ! The people around us.. They are watching us! I'm going to be angry if you don't let go!,
"So, when is the next battle? I am looking forward to fighting against powerful enemies.",
We will achieve glory in the name of Valhalla! I hope that we can be invincible under your command!,
"Because my body harbors the souls of many Valkyries, I can use all of their combat techniques.",
"No problem! With your aptitude and perception, you can easily master all of these skills!",
"I don't know, but I felt all of my sisters resonating when I arrived in response to your summons.",
"Of course we do. But when we disagree, I stop to meditate. Then, within my mind, we battle each other. When it is over, all of us listen to the winner.",
"Valkyries are excellent warriors, but unfortunately we are poor military advisors.",
"Based on our previous victories, your battle tactics have proven to be sound.",
Yes! It is a spectacular palace that is also the sanctuary of all the Nordic Valkyries.,
"Yep! If you want to experience blissful peace, you can visit my room tonight. I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay...",
"Well, it may take a long time to craft, maybe for two or three hundred years...",
"If you are unlucky, the artifact may bring curses. But don't worry, it won't kill you. At most, you will have nightmares for a few days...",
"But if there are no weapons, how can a kind person resist the invasion of evil?",
"Perhaps you are right. Weapons should be used to defend our homeland, not to invade and pillage the weak.",
It is very similar to your brave and skillful character. Speed is precious in war. There is no more effective tactic than to quickly assault the enemies' weaknesses.,
It surprised me. I never realized that your archery level is so high!,
I can boast to say that there have never been any problems with the weapons I have made so far!,
"Yes, a craftsman often needs to have the experience of building hundreds of equipment before he can become a master of a generation.",
I know you never let me down. There is no better opportunity to create a new order in doomsday.,
"Well, You can't shield it from me. You already have ambitions to command all the gods, right?",
"Really? Are you comforting me? But even if you just simply comfort me, I'm pretty happy...",
"Ah, after rule the world, even if I am a devil, I can stay with you justifiably every day, can't I?",
"Really, my little one? So why is it me that is talking to you intimately here, not other girls?",
"Ah...what an honest guy, are you interested in coming to my room tonight and spending a long night with me?",
"Yes, I'm very interested in making friends with them, such as the guy named Michael...",
It surprised me! I never thought you could really accept such extreme but wise advice!,
Hmm...your figure is also suitable for dancing! Are you interested in learning from me?,
"Hum...Dance is not only performance. If it is combined with the use of weapons, it can become a very deadly offensive method!",
"You are lucky! Give this special coin to you as a souvenir! Don't despise it, you will have good luck with it!",
"Unfortunately, it came down heads. It seems that as the goddess of victory, even if tossing a coin, I will never lose!",
I will be proud of this. I look forward to supporting my companions as best as I can in future battles.,
I... I actually had this idea a long time ago... I just...just too shy to tell others...,
"You're not wrong. But without law, the world would lose all sense of fairness and principle.",
"That pleases me. As the commander of the gods, you must understand the importance of law. An army needs order.",
The wicked will always stand trial for their evil acts. They can never escape the goddess of vengeance.,
Humans are the most unbridled and conceited race I have ever seen. Perhaps this is what allows humans to change their fate.,
"Justice has been difficult to reach since ancient times, but I will not shy away from trying. And because crime is an endless problem, my vengeance will also be endless.",
I don't want to see you share my fate. Revenge and justice are heavy burdens. I would rather see you smile.,
"I want to get rid of this ability, because instead of improving combat power, I care more about not being able to face the person I like...",
"It seems that you already have a girl you like. If you have such skill, you can't look at her well.",
"Hmm...well...then the next question is, do you mind the love between humans and the Gorgon...",
Ah... but this seems to make me even more yearning for this forbidden love...,
"Are they? ! Then I want to know, what kind of fashion do young human girls like to wear at this time?",
Ah... I'm embarrassed to hear that! It seems that inner and personality is the greatest charm...,
Are you interested in chatting with me tonight? Perhaps the wines from Crete can make us enjoy a wonderful evening.,
"Human beings were born in the dark, but yearn for the light. This is really an interesting thing...",
"Yes, maybe destiny also hopes that I will not interfere too much in the disputes in this world...",
"Ahh.. no human beings have said this to me yet, but if you want, I am looking forward to spending time with you.",
"Yes, you are right! Although my combat power is not the strongest, the most important thing in war is reconnaissance and communication!",
"It will never happen! If you don't believe me, I can fly with you and let you see it with your own eyes!",
"Next time I will draw a sketch of you! In this way, our combat power can be doubled!",
Are you interested in learning? I can teach you! But I have to make sure that your drawing skills are not too bad...,
"After this disaster is over, I will be happy to study the Chinese lute and music theory with you for the rest of the time.",
"The performance of musical instruments requires a tranquil heart and an elegant atmosphere. If you want to listen, come to my room at night...",
"If it is you to lead the gods and quell the war, this day might come as soon as possible...",
"You are right. Depression will only bury hope and determination. Instead of sighing, it is better to fight this doomsday destiny.",
"Well... As hell's number one idol and Lucifer's leading pioneer, Lilith's recent performance is not enough!",
"Stop being suspicious! If you are willing to sign, Lilith is happy to give you a solo show!",
The power of nature is always worthy of trust and reliance. She can fight better than me on the battlefield!,
"Well, on the battlefield, many enemies said the same before being stunned by her!",
Hum...Look at this awakening power. Sooner or later I will become the leader recognized by my companions!,
Why I feel that you have no confidence in me. Do you want me to give you a punch to prove it? !,
It seems that there is no difference between gods and humans. Heroes will also fight to implement the correct ideas.,
"I think so too. Instead of wasting time fighting every day, I'd rather sit down and have a cup of black tea and play poker games.",
"What are you talking about! Wait, where are you looking at? ! I'm going to be angry! !",
I think so too! The witch costume is a symbol of justice and elegance!,
"Humph! After solving the monster's troubles at the moment, I am looking forward to competing with you on the court!",
At least you are definitely not as strong as me in hitting. The broken windows in the classroom are all my masterpieces of home runs!,
You... why are you staring at my breasts? ! That does not affect my bow!,
Humph! My eyes are not bad at all. It is not a problem to throw an apple with a knife within ten meters!,
Haha! Youth are valuable on the field and on the beach!,
"What you said is really direct... Well, though I am confident about my figure...",
There is no need to doubt that everyone who has left the world will always meet again in another way.,
"Haha...When you leave this world, maybe you will understand...",
"This was also my choice, but after witnessing countless farewells, all I have left is loneliness...",
"That is quite an interesting answer. As human beings, life is like fireworks-short but brilliant.",
"Oh, it feels like you and I are so similar. Maybe you also have a little string in my fate?",
Huh... It's fun to watch human beings struggle helplessly in front of an unchangeable destiny...,
"Heehee... Staying with me, a girl in charge of bad luck, can at least protect you from bad luck.",
"Heehee...If you don't throw away the banana skin after eating the banana, you should be able to dodge a bullet...",
Let me see who you like...Wow! You are such a bold person!,
"Ah, destiny tells me that you will like a cute girl with cat ears and she likes sleeping late...",
"I am not so feeble! But... But if you want to comfort me, I'll make a change to let you hug me!",
"Wow... it's rare that you can say such artistic words, it surprised me...",
"I know a good place to bask in the sun! But I have to ask first, are you... scared of heights?",
Get used to it a few more times! Don't you want to have healthy tan skin?,
"Come on, don't be so shy... Appreciating the beautiful figure of Egyptian girls is a kind of enjoyment!",
"Really? ! Nuit thinks so too! In return, give you a kiss! Chu!",
My desert also longs for a gentle rain tonight...so...are you free tonight?,
Umbrellas are too boring! Don't you think that a girl soaked in the rain is a kind of beauty?,
It's easy to get thousands of money but hard to find a truly friend. Maybe my art exists for you...,
"If you are willing to stay with me forever, you will understand sooner or later...",
"Perhaps it is, the good and bad are ever-changing. Without the cruelty of war, how can the peace come...",
"After this disaster is over, I will go around the world with you to restore this artwork.",
"Sometimes I sigh for the mercilessness of heaven and earth, but this is also the rule of nature and it is hard to break...",
"Although I don't want to say that, kindness without power may just be weakness.",
It seems that we are heart to heart. I always hope that I can be as gentle as the earth.,
It seems that you can see the enthusiasm for art in my heart. Few people understand me like this.,
"Are you? As the best archery of the Yamato god pedigree, it becomes more worthy to compete with you!",
"After mastering the skills, it is very simple. If you are interested, I can teach you personally!",
Is that thing called TV? What kind of magic can lock people in boxes...,
"I thought it was a monster, so I shot it with one arrow... Why did you look at me and laugh! Did I do something stupid?",
"That's really exciting! See you tonight! By the way, do you want me to prepare a yukata for you? !",
Humph... Are you going to date other girls? Your face is very red...,
"Ah! So this thing is called a camera... In terms of painting and recording, this thing is much useful than the magic!",
Why are you suddenly facing me... It's too sudden! Wait wait wait! I need to change into a more beautiful kimono!,
"Really? But it's a pity that you are not an ordinary mortal or an ordinary god, even I can't predict your future.",
"In fact, whether you are a mortal or a god, knowing your own destiny is not necessarily a good thing.",
"Are you referring to the three sisters of Nornir in Norse? Possibly, I feel that there are fragments of their souls in my body...",
The three sisters of Moirai in Greece? Maybe...I feel that sometimes they appear in dreams...,
"After this disaster is over, I really hope to have the opportunity to enjoy the afternoon tea and snacks with you...",
It seems that you might be more suitable for this adventurous age when there are wars than a peaceful period...,
"From ancient times to the present, most mortals would only ask me for help, and I never thought that there would be a day when I need help from a mortal...",
Ah...Really? Then your fate is responsible for retrieving my lost divine power with me.,
Really? I feel that these so-called titles and identities have no effect other than triggering a war between the gods...,
"Yes. It is better to do something meaningful when you have time to discuss these things, such as... have a date with someone you like?",
"Because eventually these worldly things will usher in death, and the netherworld is the only eternal destination.",
"Oh? So if one day, I hope you give up everything that is mundane for me, what choice would you make?",
"Maybe you are right. I like the strong, especially those who are stronger than me and make me feel safe...",
"Love is a romantic lie that most people talk casually, but you make me feel a warmth that I have never had before.",
Hey...does it take so long to think about it? Or... I am not attractive enough in your eyes?,
"Oh dear... are you talking about me? Although I like straightforward people, being too straightforward is not romantic enough!",
"Really? Let me guess, um... you have a virus called love, and there is no cure for it!",
Emmm...is...is it a girl you like?,
"I thought you were more interested in dogs! I also like cats very much, but I am weak to their changeable personality...",
"Really? ! I especially like Shiba Inu! They are gentle, smart, and lively, you will always be in a great mood with them!",
Aha! I think so too! Cupid is too casual in her treatment of people and their fate! Love can't be a joke!,
"Awwwwww... I didn't expect that you are so gentle. Even if you think Cupid is better, I won't be angry!",
"No,I don't hate. I have seen a lot of duels on the battlefield, and have also seen romances born after these duels...",
"Hmph, I see the thread that binds you to the girls... It's so complicated that it's almost forming a net..oh my gosh...",
"This is a long journey, but I would love to have your company.",
"You are right. As far as the earth is concerned, no matter how many injuries it is, it will slowly heal over time.",
"Yes, especially after enjoying the afternoon sun with someone like you. How could it get any better?",
Mmm... Are you suggesting that I wear even less clothing when basking in order to cool off?,
,
"Yes, in some Egyptian legends, cats are messengers of gods, and some can also become cute girls!",
Oops! Where did you come from? I... I was just practicing some lines from a drama!,
Ah... I like that! It's the perfect line to shout after defeating a powerful enemy!,
"Hmph! Indeed, Nuit possesses a lot power and charm among ...",
It's rare to see you hesitate. Why don't you visit my room tonight and let me reveal the correct answer.,
"As the main god of Egypt, I should not show any weakness in front of my companions. It was a only a private lament that I shared with you.",
I would like that! Hugging you as the sun sets is the best comfort imaginable.,
"Really? Indeed, compared to other clothing, this style is the best at revealing a girl's skin and figure.",
"Normally, I'm not good at guessing, but the fire in your eyes tells me all I need to know...",
"Actually... I quite agree with you as my commander, at least you are a strong enough commander!",
"If others answer this way, I will definitely beat him up, but at least you have proved your insistence on justice with your actions.",
"This is the excellent quality needed as a commander of the gods! As your companion, I am proud of you.",
"There is no need to doubt yourself, even if you really fall into the abyss, I will always be with you.",
"Well, it isn't. Justice without power cannot fight against darkness, and tolerance does not mean indulging without principles.",
"As a mortal, I am quite surprised that you can realize this truth, and your wisdom is worthy of appreciation.",
"I had met with Lucifer on the battlefield once. Although her behavior was not justified, she was unexpectedly principled.",
"You are right, at least Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel will not agree to this easily.",
Haha... At least the time we were together was much more interesting than when I was alone.,
"Of course, I don't want to see you on the battlefield like a rookie, being beaten by the enemy then fly away tens of meters...",
"As a witch who is in charge of life and death, I not only guide the living creatures, but also need to illuminate the path for the dead.",
"This lantern illuminates the road to the underworld. Thanks to it, we can avoid a lot of monsters and troubles.",
"Oh? Regardless of whether you can do or not, at least your current momentum is quite strong, I bet you can at least hold on for... a month?",
"If you hesitate, you will lose. This is from a legendary Japanese swordsman. Well... I guess you might have heard it...",
Ah...It really made me feel a little bit disappointed. I thought you would give me a bolder answer...,
Ahhhhh...it would be too unromantic to tell you directly. How about coming to my room tonight?,
Time is the best medicine to cure the earth. I only hope that this war can end as soon as possible.,
It doesn't matter. The earth will always take something from me and give it to a more suitable person.,
I fear she won't take our struggle seriously. She has also caused more trouble in Egypt than she has ever solved.,
"She is indeed good at strength, but as the commander, you will soon realize that she doesn't quite understand what a command is...",
You are still too young. Only when you become the ruler recognized by the gods can you truly understand the meaning of loneliness.,
"Interesting. I have seen countless kings, and no one has ever said that. You are indeed a unique commander.",
"It is the pillar of this Nordic country. As a former king, I miss the feeling of standing on the top of a tree and looking down on everything...",
"Few humans will give me such a firm answer, maybe you can really become the leader of the gods.",
"Hmph...If other people say this, I will only think that he is a fool, but I agree with your ability and wisdom.",
"This is a bet that risking life, but I believe that with you, there is no enemy that can make us fear.",
"I was willing to pay the price of one eye in order to gain wisdom, but I understand that the wise man will always be invincible.",
"I used to be the ruler of the gods, but you are the future of the gods. I hope you can hold this glory for me.",
"It seems that the times have changed. Now, as a companion of the gods, it is indeed easier for me to get close to others than as the commander of the gods.",
Really? It seems that someone deserves to spend a night on me and entertain him with a good bottle of mead.,
This is really distressing! My ideal is to be an idol!,
"Oh, really? ! To prevent accidents, should I find a rope to trap you on the mast?",
"Yes, doomsday is not over yet, I don't want to see erupting volcanoes and dusty ruins.",
"Of course I can go ashore, the premise is that you can hold me, haha...",
So that's true! This is so exciting...ah no no no.. so regrettable...,
Haha! How could I? I just want to see the face of the god of the sea who is majestic in the past...,
Everything follows the rules of nature. There is no need to avoid fate. The tribulation will make the earth more solid.,
"No, I won't. Everything is endless and cyclical. Even if it is silent for a while, it will eventually be reborn on the earth.",
"So no matter what trouble you encounter, please tell me. At least I should face it with you.",
"Hmm... It seems that in your eyes, I am much younger than I thought...",
You have the same strong will and soul like mine. I hope that the gods can survive this calamity under your command...,
"Indeed. No matter how strong a person is, he may not have enough reliable companions.",
Even the simplest flower can use its unique fragrance to dispel the dark clouds of war.,
"Trees are a sign of recovery. Even they are not beautiful as flowers, they can slowly heal the scars of the earth.",
"Of course, if I were to return to the heyday of divine power, then end this doomsday... I am afraid it will only take a few days.",
"Don't worry, I will not be depressed because of this. After witnessing your growth, I have fresh hope.",
Ah...really? ! I will throw you into the center of the labyrinth tomorrow to see if this is true.,
"In fact, if you have the power as orc, you can destroy walls when you face them, and sooner or later you can get out.",
"Find an idea worthy of sacrifice. Whether you are confused or fearful, I will always guard you.",
"Haha...Always immersed in dreams, dreams are reality, is there anything more wonderful than this...",
"Hmph, what an unromantic guy, at least I have dreams.",
"For me, this is really not easy...but with you, maybe I can change myself.",
"Then in order to make this dream come true, it seems that people all over the world will never be able to wake up.",
"Ok, is it? But only the strong can control the destiny of himself and the world, is that right?",
There is no difference between good and evil in the world. Maybe kindness is only defined by the strong...,
You're right. What's the point if gained love by this kind of ability?,
"Oh, what an honest and cute guy! Then tell me honestly...what are you thinking about now?",
Haha! I won't lose like last time! Take that!,
Hey! Not that excuse again! Ah... Forget it! I'll practice alone with a combat dummy.,
"Exactly. Fire was the first great discovery, and now civilization thrives on it.",
"Perhaps. The flame brings wisdom, but it also ignites disputes in the kingdom and the desire to plunder...",
Exactly! Troublesome people just need a good punch. If that's not enough... uh... then two punches!,
"I'm too hot-tempered to reason. But every time, you manage to calm me down.",
There is nothing better than a big bowl of rice topped with chili peppers and roast meat just before battle!,
Hmm... But girls who like hot are always popular! Whether it's character or figure...,
You have really good taste! Do you want to come to my room and...let me teach you how to dress...?,
"It's troublesome to wrap it around, but it's very convenient to take it off! Do you want to try it?",
"Youth is an invaluable wealth. No matter appearance, vitality or passion, it is meaningful with youth!",
No way? ! I have never seen a mortal who does not long for eternal youth!,
"Haha, I heard that the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite are fighting hard for this!",
"You think it won't? ! Let's make a bet. I think of a funny prank, hee hee...",
"You didn't lie to me, did you? If you lie to me, I will never forgive you!",
That's right... Most often mortals' love will disappear with the passing of youth.,
Music is the soul of a song. Are you interested in listening to me sing a song?,
Poetry can always express people's emotions well. Would you like to see my new poetry?,
"If you are willing to exchange with me, I will give you an extraordinary gift!",
"Awww, you are such a liar! If you don't give it to me, I will scratch you!",
"Oh! ! Did you say I'm so cute, right? ! It must be so! !",
"Hum, I will sneak into your bedroom tonight and eat you, be careful miaow...",
Really? ! How about next time I invite you to a party with animal monster friends? !,
Miaow...Is it the kind of shy relationship that makes people blush...You are really direct meow...,
"Well, if you are willing to give me fish, then I'll allow you to touch meow!",
I never thought who could hold back our furry temptation strikes! Are you really a human meow? !,
Really? Although I did see a lot of good people before I became a monster...,
Alas...it's a shame to have fish but don't know how to share it with friends miaow...,
Is it? ! Humph! I will definitely become your most reliable comrade miaow! !,
I think I'm strong miaow. Such a big stone can be crushed with just one paw!,
I must end this catastrophe with you and regain the divine power that originally belonged to me!,
"I should also be grateful for this destiny. If it weren't like this, I wouldn't meet you...",
"Really? I have never seen a human being able to beat me, and I must compete with you if I have a chance!",
"Do you want me to teach you surfing? I will hold you tight, at least you don't have to worry about sinking to the bottom...",
"In the days of Olympus, the wars are endless. I was already tired of wars...",
"If there is a day when the war is over, how about taking you to the underwater palace and living with me?",
"You have good taste. The lotus flower is born in the mud but emerges spotless, just as rightful justice is born from a world of constant strife.",
"In my perspective, blood is the inheritance of the family. Even if the bonds are fragile, it is an unbreakable reality bestowed by the gods.",
"In my percepective, blood is the inheritance of the family. Even if the bonds are fragile, it is an unbreakable reality bestowed by the gods.",
"Maybe you are right, for the bond we share proves that other types of relationshps may be even stronger.",
"Well, you are right. Grief should be used as a driving force to prevent disaster.",
"Princess Bari may be much weaker than me, but she never stops fighting. And neither shall I.",
"Well, you are right. Grief should be turned into a drive to prevent disaster.",
"I don't know when the war will end. In the meantime, I hope we can save more lives.",
A companion? I... I thought we are much more than that.,
"Well... there are many kinds of family members, such as siblings, lovers, etc... What kind of family should we be?",
I used to think prayers were simply a way for mortals to comfort ourselves. But then the gods saved me and transformed me into what I am today.,
"Yes, the gods have caused many problems in the world, leaving humans to clean up behind them.",
"Yes, I have eleven more companions, but they seem to be sealed by power from a different time and space.",
"It doesn't make sense for you to do this, because not all of my companions are good at fighting like me...",
"Hum...Actually, I only responded to you when there is a fight!",
"In fact, before I was summoned to this place, I lived a simple life, because I just need to eat up the tribute!",
"It depends on the things! If it is delicious food, I can memorize the entire recipe!",
This is too alienated! I don't want to call such an unromantic name when we are dating!,
"Ah...Really? But if there is too much strength, will it be too lack of girly...?",
Well... You seem to be questioning my power? Do you want to come to my room tonight to...compare with me?,
Beliefs can indeed converge into divine power! Isn't it the same way that powerful gods were born?,
"It is! Look at your companions, you are their belief. The power of this belief is unstoppable!",
"I never thought I'd see the day when I would give my heart to another! I swear I never shot one of my arrows at you. It was fate, and fate alone!",
"Hmph... Because of your sincerity, I accept these flowers. ... Wait! I see that proud look on your face! Don't forget that I still retain my independence!",
"A poet once wrote: We are all angels with only one wing, we can only fly by embracing each other. Today, I finally understand what they mean. From now on, we will face our destiny together.",
"I used to think that having a cold, hard heart made me stronger. But you helped me see the true strength of a mutual and unbreakable bond.",
"Ahh... I see you can't resist the charm of chaos. You seem eager for this eternal vow and what it represents. You are so direct and eager, but these are also great strengths!",
"The moonlight is really beautiful tonight, isn't it? Exchanging vows with you on the night of a full moon is a blessing that will always be worth remembering.",
"Just like my devotion to Bifrost, I will not waiver in my vow to you. I swear by the glory of the Nordic gods that from henceforth, we shall face all the trials of destiny together!",
"I recognize your courage. Despite your youth, you are the only person brave enough to make an eternal vow with me. In the years ahead, I will happily share my experience as a ruler with you.",
"You humans really do make a ritual of marriage. After observing you for so long, I've found that I have feelings for you that are difficult to analyze rationally.",
"Does this vow mean we will be together for our entire lives? That's wonderful, but... I hope you like eating barbecue for every meal.",
"Nothing makes me happier than this eternal vow. As the incarnation of light, I promise to drive away the darkness for you until the day the sun no longer rises.",
,
"Even before this vow, you were like family to me. I am very grateful for this eternal bond between us. May the Goddess of Water protect you, the most important member of my family.",
My vow with you is also a kind of magic which only the sacred power of love and trust can activate. Do you understand?,
"Every day at sunset, I dreamed of finding the one who would make an eternal vow with me. Now destiny has brought you to me. I hope we can live happily together in the days to come.",
"You will now spend all eternity with me, but at a cost: We shall reside together in the underworld. Haha! Did you know these details before you made your vow?",
You are a very brave human to make an eternal vow with me--the god of death. I look forward to sleeping each night in your arms.,
"Partings and reunions are part of nature's cycle, and spiritual bonds are its most precious blessing. I will not let this apocalypse weather my commitment. My vow to you will be as eternal as stone.",
"I am accustomed to the loneliness imposed by justice. I am grateful for the kindness you bring to my life. Perhaps, I made a good choice with you.",
I could feel the radiance of your soul the moment you made your vow. You are more courageous than any hero in Valhalla. It is my eternal honor and joy to accompany you on the battlefield.,
You are so sly! You never hinted that you might want to make a vow with me. All this time I misunderstood your intentions. I'm so bad at these things.,
,
"Once we make this vow to each other, will I never be able to return to my own world? Hmm... We have gotten along well together. I probably wouldn't mind staying here in your world with you.",
"I have listened to countless wishes and sent countless gifts, but this vow with you is more precious to me than any gift in the world! Did you know that?",
"I'm shocked that you were willing to make a sacred vow with me, an ordinary monster. May the Yamato gods bless us with happiness and protect our souls.",
Making our vows is like crafting equipment. It requires hard work and determination. I vow henceforth to be your sharpest sword and your strongest shield!,
"Ha! Did you know that countless demons, devils, and angels have offered their vows to me? But you are the only human to make me genuinely willing to accept?",
"You should know that I made this vow with you only because you seem very unlucky. Without my help, your luck will only get worse!",
"From ancient times to the present, I seldom make vows. But whenever we're together, I find myself wanting time to pass more slowly. I have never been so firm in my vows before.",
"We come from entirely different worlds. I can't believe the gods allowed us to meet! Oh, by the way, would you mind if we took a picture as a souvenir?",
"Nothing makes me feel more at ease than an eternal vow. Whether it is in heaven or the netherworld, I, as a god, have no regrets about spending eternity with someone worthy of my trust.",
You seem very eager to make this vow with me. Are you no longer satisfied with our mentor-student relationship? You seem like someone who can't handle being alone.,
I am grateful for this eternal vow. I will always be there for you when you need me. Always trust in the power bestowed by the earth.,
"Humph! This vow won't excuse you from our daily training sessions and the fury of my fists. After all, we must be prepared to guard each other's backs on the battlefield.",
"Even the goddess of victory suffers from fear and anxiety. But with this vow, I feel courage in the depths of my soul. From now on, we will lead our companions to victory together.",
Our vow is a symbol of justice. I sense the light of justice in your soul instead of the darkness of revenge. Perhaps we can work together to bring true order.,
"Make an eternal vow with me? Uh... do you mean you want to be turned into stone? Wait...wait! I'm just kidding! Actually, I just wanted to watch you panic.",
I have been waiting for this day for a long time! Hey? Why are you staring at me? Are you hoping for a kiss? Haha... This is the first time I've seen you blush.,
"This eternal vow is a union of our souls and beliefs. I have experienced countless dangers and trials, and now that you are with me, we will surely end this apocalyptic catastrophe.",
"Traditionally, sirens sing when making their vows. But I am worried you would faint from happiness if I were to sing here and now. I should wait until the evening when we are alone.",
"As the goddess of dreams, I have dreamt of this many times before. But I never imagined that you would be so willing to make an eternal vow with me in reality.",
I know that someday the end of your life will separate us. You are but a mere mortal. Yet I am still happy to make this vow. You will remain young in my heart forever.,
"I worry that I may never regain my powers, which sleep in the depths of the sea. But when sharing this vow with you, that concern seems far less important.",
"Humans used to fear the darkness of night. But now that we have made our vow, the night will no longer cause you to cower in fear. Instead, it will serve as a shield to protect you.",
"As a messenger for the gods, I like to be one step ahead of everything. But don't you think our relationship is moving... too fast? I'm so excited that my heart is jumping out of my chest!",
"I used to think vows were nonsense because everything fades with time. However, your soul resonates with mine, for you hope to face eternity with me.",
"An eternal vow with me? Haha... What a strange human... But I would appreciate spending our time together judging the dead. It's such a boring task, and I would love to share the work.",
"I have foreseen this moment since the day I met you. Destiny can be so boring, but you bring a lot of surprises.",
"Our vows create a dependence between our souls, much like that between lush trees and nourishing soil. I will always do my best to protect you like the earth.",
"Ah... If I make this vow, does it mean that I only belong to you? But I want to be everyone's sweet heart!",
"The union of two souls through a vow is like preparing medicine. When blended, two ingredients, no matter how common, can create a miracle.",
"Even a leaf or a bunch of flowers can release nature's energy. Although my ability to control the earth fades, I will still do my best to support you in battle.",
"Hmph... I am not interested in making a vow with someone aligned with justice. However, you have proven your strength, and that interests me...",
"Angels must make vows with humans to ensure they do not stray down an evil path. May our spiritual bond bring you courage and wisdom, and may my love for you dispel your fear.",
"Wow! I'm surprised that you chose to make a vow with me! Although I cannot give you eternal life, I promise to make you the most beautiful mummy in the world!",
Awwww...I am very happy to earn your approval and make an eternal vow with you! But this little cutie next to me seems...er.. not pleased about this...,
"Vows? My race does not make these. But if I make one with you, we can fight together to defeat our enemies in battle. How convenient!",
"We have already placed our trust in each other, so a vow is irrelevant. Still, I am pleased with the gentleness that comes from the depths of your soul.",
May our vows unite our destinies. May our souls stay united until the end of the world. ... What do you think of that vow? I wrote it last night!,
"I still remember when this apocalypse began and, for the first time, I answered the call of a mortal. Perhaps we were meant to resolve this catastrophe together.",
Hmm... I actually wonder how you felt when you saw me after you first summoned an angel?,
"Ah...As a species of fish, life on land is very uncomfortable for me!",
"When I was able to incarnate into a human form, I was worried about whether my figure would be too fat!",
Are you interested in basking with me?,
"War is the most stupid thing... No matter where, as long as a war starts, all creatures will suffer.",
Hmm...what do you think is the difference between gods and monsters?,
"Love is the most mysterious existence in the world. Many wars begin with it, and end with it...",
Do you like animals like cats? What do you think of the cat's character?,
"Frankly speaking, I am not disgusted with war. It brings destruction and killing, but it also brings courage and glory.",
"War may cause nature to suffer short-term pain, but it can bring brightness to new life.",
"The biggest difference between gods and humans is courage and responsibility, don't you think so?",
Leading the Nordic heroes who died in battle to Valhalla is a mission as well as an art.,
Gifts are actually very holy things. What do you think gifts can bring to people?,
"Actually, I don't think that gods and humans should be different in terms of their identities. What do you think?",
I actually like children very much. They always face things with simple and naive minds.,
"Alas...for this doomsday with wars, perhaps peace is the best gift, right?",
What kind of gift do you like to receive? Would you like me to give you a surprise at Christmas?,
"Actually, before the gift is given out, I don't know what things will be taken out from the gift bag either...",
Surprise?,
Panic?,
Is it too hot?,
Is it too dry?,
Actually you have a perfect figure!,
It seems a bit...,
I'm afraid I have no time...,
War is the mother of peace.,
I think there is no difference.,
Arrogant?,
Docile?,
The war is too cruel.,
This is a kind of rebirth.,
But the price of war is high.,
I agree.,
I think it is strength.,
This duty is very sacred.,
Am I qualified to go?,
Hope?,
Joy?,
I don't really agree.,
Being simple is not necessarily a good thing.,
I will end the war!,
Peace is not easy...,
"Hmmm, sweet love?",
Humph! A tremendous strength!,
Mystery is not bad!,
I feel a bit scared suddenly...,
"When humans try new things, they are always a bit happy and a bit fearful. In angels' view, it is actually quite interesting.",
"Fortunately, it was me who responded to your summon, not Michael or Lucifer, otherwise you would suffer...",
"Yeah, even when I walk on the beach in a swimsuit, I can feel countless hot gazes!",
"That's right, but I don't have the luxury of asking for a hot bath every day in this era of rampant monsters.",
Oops... It seems that you know how to make girls happy more than I expected... Don't say this to anyone please~,
"No way! Are you kidding me? ! If it is true, I will start losing weight today! Now!",
See you soon! I know a very nice beach where we can enjoy our time!,
Hum...do you have dates with other girls? It seems that I am a step late...,
"So it is very important to end this war as soon as possible, and I will definitely do my best to help you!",
"Maybe our monster's mind is simple, I don't understand the connotation of what you said...",
"Then stop thinking if you don't know! At least I prefer to be a monster, because I never have to worry about so many troubles like a god!",
"Aha... I think so too, everyone is constantly tempering from the ordinary body to gain powerful strength.",
"Wasn't the Trojan war that the Greek gods instigated, in the eyes of mortals, also because of love?",
"When you have a sweetheart and are willing to fight the world for her, maybe you can understand...",
"Indeed, cats seem elegant and docile, but their self-esteem is not inferior to those beasts, and it is a bad thing to annoy them.",
It seems that you know how to get the approval of these little cuties. It's not easy to make them docile!,
"Well, people only see the dark side of war, but rarely see the nobility and holiness behind the blood and the blade.",
"Though death befalls all men alike, many Nordic warriors would rather sacrifice their lives honorably for their ideals than living their lives in mediocrity.",
"Life and death are a kind of reincarnation, so is destiny, so is love, and so is war. Everything is impermanent.",
"In fact, the price of war will make people cherish the hard-earned peace even more, don't they?",
"Therefore, not everyone can become the ruler of the gods. After all, the responsibility that the ruler has to bear is beyond expression.",
"You are right. If you observe carefully, you will find that powerful people are often brave and responsible.",
"Yes, both I and the Valkyries in Valhalla take this as their glory!",
"Not at the moment, at least you can't go until you die on the battlefield, but...I don't want to see this day come...",
"Yep, there is nothing more exciting than receiving a warm love when you are upset or sad.",
Indeed. I have never seen a child who doesn't roll all over the floor happily after receiving a lot of candies.,
"So, whether you are a mortal or a god, we don't have to treat each other too rigidly, right?",
"It doesn't make a difference to me, because when I give gifts, I won't be biased because of status!",
"I think worries will increase when thinking more, in this doomsday world, maybe it's not bad to simply live each day well.",
That's right! Children never think about whether tomorrow will be the end of the world. They always look at everything optimistically.,
"I can feel your determination. If you can really do it, I will give you the most precious gift in the world.",
"Don't be too pessimistic, peace is always born in people's hopes and expectations, even if it comes slowly...",
"Ahhhhh...do you mean...you want me, as a gift?",
"Ok, will satisfy you! As long as I go with you for battle every time, it is already the most powerful combination!",
That's it! It is also a pleasure to enjoy the surprise before opening the gift box!,
Ahhh... your expression makes me want to bully you! Guess what prank is in this box...?,

Are you sure you want to use a Magic Star Ring to vow to the angel?,
"Hey, sister! I found that my flame was suddenly hotter several times than before!",
"Judging from the change in magic power, you should have gained power similar to mine.",
"A new power of awakening? OMG... Look at your eyes, that makes me have a bad feeling...",
"Sister, you are right! I have long wanted to try new powers! Let's fight!",
Stop it! We surrendered!,
No way? ! I just finished warming up!,
I feel that your power needs to constantly fight the strong to be fully awakened.,
This is really an exciting thing!,
Wait! I don't mean to let you in trouble with other gods!,
"Uh, I heard that there is a monster invading at the gate of Nuwa temple...Why it's you?",
Well... I don't care if I am described as a monster. Let's fight!,
"Huh? I just want to use my fists, wondering if there is someone who caused trouble to let me beat!",
Then stop speaking rubbish! A good fight is more important than anything else!,
"Ahem... I didn't expect that as the god of fire, I would lose to your flames.",
It's so boring! I thought it would take several days to know who is the winner!,
"In my opinion, perhaps only the powerhouse of the main god-level be able to fight you.",
Really? ! Then I'll go to boss Odin and fight with her! See you later!,
"Oh, she actually believed it. There will be funny things, haha...",
"Hi, boss! I'm coming to fight with you! Oh, you are here too, sun god...",
Ah... Isn't this the hot-tempered cutie that Odin loves the most?,
I am surprised that the Nordic dragons can also have such a strong potential...,
Look at your exciting face. Do you want the sun god to fight with you?,
That's really a most welcome thing!,
Huh... It seems that you have awakened an incredible power...,
"The brilliance from sun seems to be unable to cover your flames, this is extraordinary...",
"I didn't expect I can burst this strong power, but I am also approaching the limit...",
"But in the battle just now, I seemed to be aware of the magic power of creator goddess.",
"Oh? This is really interesting discovery, I will investigate it carefully...",

"Wow, it seems like you have awakened a new power!",
I feel like..my body is full of furious lightning...,
"Oh? Honey, are you finally mad for studying magic powers desperately?",
It seems that only a fight can prove the power of the lightning!,
Then there is no need to say anything more! Come on!,
It shocks me that the destructive power of your lightning seems to be greatly improved compared to before!,
And probably neither the ice nor the flames can affect you.,
I think that the lightning made a shield for me during the battle.,
And this shield should be able to avoid all unfavorable conditions for you.,
"I also thought of a new skill that can penetrate the opponent's defense, maybe I can have a try.",
"Dare to challenge us three high-level defenders, I should praise your courage.",
Humph...I don't want you to think that I am the immature scholar before.,
Are you? Then let the steady earth come to confront your lightning.,
No one's attack can penetrate the defense of what I claim to be the strongest guardian in Norse.,
Really? ! Then let you guys see the thunderstorm that crush everything!,
"Surprisingly, this thunderstorm can make people tremble all over, unable to focus on defense...",
Hum... It seems that the powerful armor is powerless when facing this kind of thunderstorm.,
"In my opinion, this kind of thunderstorm can also form a large-scale explosion.",
"Indeed, compared to my past self, I feel that having both attacking and defense is the best strategy.",
"Hmph... I will make good use of the awakening power, to solve this doomsday crisis.",

"Heh...Are you the only one who can summon the illusion of Odin's, right?",
,
"No one is interested in your dirty name, Cthulhu Loki.",

How is this possible that Odin's powerful attack didn't knock down anyone? !,
Is this out of your guess? Do you think your brain is unreliable anymore?,
"Unexpectedly, you can use the horn to link the souls of your companions and take the attack on their behalf...",
You never want to knock down my companions before I fall down!,
Very good... I would love to let you experience the fury of the strongest saboteur in Northern Europe!,
Damn... is this the awakened storm dragon?,
"So far, no one can resist such a fierce attacking role among the Nordic dragons!",
"You are in big trouble, but I want to see if luck is always on your side!",
Everyone stays in formation! Don't panic!,
This is impossible... Your power has never been so strong before...,
God will grow up and I look forward to the moment when I beat you down.,

"When stationed at spar spring,increasing the productivity of spar",
"Yvette was one of the first among the group of centaur sages to wake up from their deep sleep, and the first to discover that the crystal mine had a special architectural effect. She is very familiar with nature, and can make crystals produced in the spring water richer based on her rich experience and mastery of earth magic. She is very disgusted with war, but it does not mean that she is not good at fighting. After all, she feels very fortunate that the Eudemons can enjoy the rare peace.",
Flame Affinity,
"When stationed at lava lake, increasing the productivity of Enhance Essence",
"As a member of the Phoenix family, Nefertari is among one of the few races that is not afraid of flames. It is precisely because of this ability that only she can extract extra Enhance Essence from the hot lava of the volcano, and she has always been proud of it. Although she looks very young, no one knows how long she has lived. It is said that she has been asleep most of the time, so her mental age is more like a child.",
Holy Core Prayer,
"When staioned at holy core altar, increasing the productivity of holy core",
"Eleanor herself has the terrifying near-divine power, and this allows her to do things that many gods can't match. For example, she can pray to higher gods through powerful magic power, thereby creating extremely precious holy cores. Although Eleanor was born in a dark abyss, she is very gentle to anyone and has the mature charm of a big sister.",
Diamond Craft,
"When staioned at gem mine, increasing the productivity of gem",
"Although Fenrir's character looks careless, she is far more familiar with diamonds than others, and she can always find better diamonds. In addition to being good at finding ore veins, she is also very good at cutting and making diamonds, especially when using her sharp claws for this work. She inherited the name of the Nordic ancestors. She was an out-and-out militant, but also could easily indulge in banquets and parties.",
Gem Alchemy,
"When staioned at Atelier, increasing the productivity of diamond",
"Only monsters like Yukizakura, who have survived for thousands of years, can use unknown alchemy techniques to refine gems from ordinary ore. As a member of the noble nine-tailed foxes family, Yukizakura doesn't care about her identity. She is happy to see her achievements being recognized and put to use. Unlike others who are keen on war, Yukizakura is very disgusted with war, and she will not hesitate to form an alliance with those who pursue peace.",

"It only grows on the Divine Tree of Creation in the Seventh domain, and it is said to be a priceless treasure that can greatly increase the lifespan of the eater.",
"Exquisite gadget made of bird feathers, it has a outstanding effect on tickling, but according to Eudemons, too much tickling will be addictive...",

"Huh? Gabriel, is this a portal? Do you know how to activate it?",
How would I know? Why don't you try yelling Open Sesame?,
,
But you still fell for it- Wait! Why is the portal starting to glow!?,
,
,
"Did you hear that?! As long as we fix it, we'll be able to discover the secret at the other side of the portal!",
"Why are you staring at me so eagerly!? You don't expect me to fix this broken portal, do you?!",
"C'mon, honey. Please fix it for me? I'm dying to know! I know you can do it!",
,
"Gabriel...has the portal been fixed? You have been fixing it for a week, would you like me to help?",
"No need! If I ask you for help, this portal will fall apart in seconds!",
"I'm not that stupid, am I...? Wait! There seems to be movement in the portal? !",
"It seems to be connected, it's clearer than last time! Can you hear me? Testing! Testing!",
"Hello? Hello?! Gabriel, do you know who is that on the other side?!",
,
"Don't worry, this is Chaos Realm, and the monsters dare not come here...",
"Chaos Realm? Gabriel, do you know this place?",
,
,
Just what? Ah ah ah! It's disconnected! Gabriel! ! Hurry! Fix the portal! ! !,
,
"Don't worry, although it hasn't been completely fixed, it can be opened more or less smoothly.",
"This portal seems to only respond to your commands, and you can activate it by putting your hand on the door.",
"Only respond to my orders? It's really weird... Try it, let's turn it on! !",
Yo... It's really surprising that two people can complete the repair of the portal.,
"You don't have the temperament of a god but you have a godhead...I see, you are an Eudemon, right?",
,
"Eudemons? Gabriel, what is Eudemons?",
"Servants of the gods, or legendary creatures? I actually don't know much.",
,
Oh no... the connection is broken again. It seems that we have to fix the portal thoroughly.,
"Ah... the door is broken again. Previously, we could still see the scene on the other side of the door...",
Gabriel is also lazy too! It's so irritating! Open it! Open it! !,
It's so noisy! Who is yelling out there! Do you want to fight? !,
Sorry... I... I just want to activate the portal and go to the other side to have a look...,
Stop dreaming! No one can pass this portal because of the enchantment that prevents crossing!,
Enchantment that prevents crossing? Do you mean that outsiders can't get in through the portal?,
"Yes! And the Eudemons inside the door can't come out, do you understand?",
Do you know who created the enchantment? Maybe we can think of a way...,
"There are rumors that it was created by the God of Creation, but I think no one can say for sure.",
Besides! Next time if you yell again... I'll bite your head off!,
,
,
Gabriel! look! I successfully passed through the portal!,
"My God, I think it's a miracle that you, with that desperate character can survive till now.",
,
See! And I remember your companion said that no one can pass through this portal.,
"In fact, it is not impervious to pass, but it will endure huge enchantment energy when passing through.",
,
,
"Unless this person is the creator of the enchantment, but you can't have anything to do with this matter...",
"Don't worry about so much! I've made my mind! Even if it is burnt to ashes, I have to go to the otherside to have a look!",
,
It really surprised me. I never thought that there was a paradise behind this door.,
"Yo... So you have already arrived, I thought you wouldn't come so soon.",
"I am Yukizakura, the leader of the Eudemons here, the eldest daughter of the Nine-Tailed clan, pleased to meet you.",
"Nice to meet you too! You are the Eudemons sister that you met last time, eh? Are you alone?",
Hehe... Do you think the line that welcomes you is too short?,
"How come! Just curious, I have spoken to many Eudemons before.",
"Then let me lead the way, and let me introduce another companion to you.",
"By the way, I can also familiarize you with this place, I believe you will be interested...",
"By the way, Yvette, there seems to be many ruins-like buildings here.",
"Yes, this is the mine that I told you before, and we are unlocking them one by one.",
Do you see the ruins at the spring on the top of the mountain? I just unlocked it the other day.,
"The spring around it is rich in a kind of spar mine, which is an important resource for construction.",
Very beautiful ruins! Let's go check it out!,
"You see, putting spar on the altar of the ruins can increase the production capacity of the ruins.",
I can't wait to try out!,
"By the way, in addition to upgrading the ruins themselves, many Eudemons have unique knowledge of the ruins.",
"If they are dispatched into the ruins, the mining efficiency of the ruins can be further improved.",
"For example, I have been studying the Spar Spring for a long time, and I know how it works.",
"Well, I will try my best to seek help from other Eudemons.",
"Okay, let's talk about the rest later, I'm going to start work in the ruins, see you later!",
,
"In fact, the principle is similar, it is called Gate of seeking, it is our common means of transportation.",
"You just need to think about what you want to do or who you want to meet, and the gate will open the right passage.",
Is it so amazing? ! This is so convenient!,
"In fact, this is not the case, because the energy of the gate is limited and it can only be opened a few times a day.",
And sometimes it will open the wrong passage and may send you to an unexplainable place.,
"I decided to try first. I want to find the Centaur sister I saw when I opened the portal for the first time, can I?",
I don't know if you can find her. Let's see how lucky you are.,
"This is really the grace of the gods! Unexpectedly, you were the first to cross the enchantment!",
"Now that you are here, Yvette, I will go and work on alchemy. How about you leave the rest to you?",
"I suggest to take our guests to the Forest of Eudemons, Elena has just built the residence.",
Forest of Eudemons? What is that place?,
"It is the lair of the Eudemons, we will understand when we get there.",
"The Forest of Eudemons is our resting place, and each Eudemon has its own private room.",
"Quite interesting, the same as our human school dormitory?",
"Yes, more importantly, Eudemons who have good enough relationships with you will invite you into their room",
They will also sign an alliance contract with you to help you do what they can.,
For real? ! How should I have a good relationship with everyone?,
,
"Phew, I'm also a little tired. Shall I take you to my room for a cup of tea?",
Is this... the contract you made with me?,
"Yes, I hope we can try our best to help each other.",
"By the way, I haven't asked, do you need any of my help?",
"The Eudemons have been trapped in this enchantment for a long time, and they have not been able to find a way out.",
I hope you can find a way to break the enchantment of this world and let us be free.,
"I see, so what can you do to help me?",
We can channel our powers to the gods of your world and help them.,
"In addition, although the enchantment restricts our actions, it has no effect on non-living bodies.",
"And there are many precious minerals that can be mined, and each Eudemon has a unique mining ability.",
,
"By the way, Yvette! I remembered that there was a small gift that I forgot to give you.",
Oh? What is it? Eudemons are always happy with gifts.,
It is the fruit picked in the forest. Yukizakura seems to like it very much. I think you will like it too.,
"Ah... this kind of fruit is called Reiki fruit, and it is indeed a favorite food for Eudemons.",
"I will accept it, thank you for taking me the grace of the gods.",
Does it taste good? I even had the illusion that you were full of energy after eating.,
"In fact, you are right, this kind of fruit can indeed enhance our strength!",
"Some fruits even possess very powerful magical powers, which can make Eudemons immortal.",
No way! Is there such a thing? Then I have to collect them well.,
Hey? ! Am I dreaming? ! Are you the human who repaired the portal?,
"Ah, it turned out to be you, I was checking the status of Spar spring, please don't disturb me.",
"Um? how can I help you? If you want to talk, you can go to my room.",
"I have been to this forest many times, but there are still many places that I haven't explored.",
,
You said you want me to help you go to the volcano to mine resources? Hmm... let me think about it.,
"It's you, I also go out occasionally, it's too boring to stay in the crater every day.",
I plan to let the volcano erupt once! This can bring more valuable resources!,
"Unlike other humans who are afraid of fire, you seem to like coming to the volcano!",
"Yo, I didn't expect to meet you here, I am Eleanore the Kraken, pleased to meet you.",
"I'm restoring the power of Holy core altar, and should be able to help you a lot after completion.",
"I understand that you need my help urgently, but I am not ready yet, I am afraid you will have to wait.",
"I occasionally come to rest at the waterfall at the foot of the mountain, after all, I still like to stay in the water.",
,
"Are you here for patrol? Everything is normal at the altar, and today's harvest is very rich.",
"Ah! You are the one who interrupted my nap before! I, Fenrir, must bite off your head today!",
Want me to help you to dig a diamond mine? Then you'd better bring me some delicious steaks when we meet next time.,
"Actually, I don't want to sleep every day. If you hire me to work, I might consider it.",
"It's you again, do you have any delicious steaks? If so, I will help you take care of the mine!",
Look at this beautifully cut diamond! This is my masterpiece!,
"Hmm... I seem to have discovered a new vein, waiting for my good news!",
ZZZ... Ah! It's you! Don't look at me and laugh! I... I didn't slack off and take a nap!,
Oh... isn't this the human cutie? What a coincidence I met you.,
"Well, thank you for your trust in me, but I haven't figured out whether to form an alliance with you.",
"It's you, I just finished searching for the materials needed for alchemy. Would you like to take a walk together?",
The technique of using alchemy to synthesize gems is still very difficult. Please give me some more time.,
"Today's alchemy is also very successful, and I hope that the output of gems will also satisfy you.",
,
"what! It's you, are you interested in accompany me to enjoy the sakura blossoms tonight? Tonight is a good time!",
"You can cross the enchantment to come here, it must be the grace of the gods, may our friendship be forever.",
,
,
"Seeing that you provide me with delicious steaks, I will help you run the Diamond Workshop!",
It seems that only an excellent alchemist like me is worthy of your ambition.,

Jade Hare,
"Chang'e once lived alone on the moon, only able to admire our bustling blue planet from a lonely distance.\nShe remained alone with her thoughts until the Jade Hare joined her, providing companionship and helping to fill Guanghan Palace with the goddess's laughter.",
Exclusive Limited: Chang'e,
"Chang'e was born a mortal but later stole from Xiwangmu the Pill of Immortality, which transformed her into a goddess. \nShe then fled to the Guanghan Palace on the moon and spent millennia in solitude. And now that the world is ending, she has decided to help to resolve the crisis.",
"You like rabbits, too!? Then you must be a good person. That's reason enough for me to make this vow with you!",
Do you like bunnies?,
Do you think the world has changed a lot? So much has happened in the last few thousand years.,
"You wanted to know what I thought of war? I am a pacifist, but you seem to be... a militant?",
"After a thousand years at Guanghan Palace, I sometimes miss my past life and my former companions.",
"Do you know of my past? After thousands of years on the moon, I have forgotten almost everything.",
,
,
The change is indeed not small.,
Hmm... It doesn't seem like much has changed.,
...You guessed correctly!,
Memories can be very motivating.,
I rarely miss the past.,
,
"Your story is a legend, and I know it well.",
Do you want me to chat with you?,
Is that why you're so talkative?,
"Do you want to help me raise them? I have kept hundreds of them in the Guanghan Palace, and I am worried that one person can't take care of all of them!",
No way! I can't believe these furry little cuties don't excite you. I'm shocked!,
I'm glad I chose to return from Guanghan Palace! I've been wanting to get involved in the action for a long time.,
"Eh? Is that so? ... But then again, you are still very young. You have not seen much of the world and its history.",
Huh? It isn't? Yet you fight so bravely... It causes my heart to stir.,
"Although I don't like fighting with people, in my opinion, war is more interesting than practicing alone in the Guanghan Palace.",
"Indeed, every time I thought about returning, my practice routine felt more invigorating.",
It seems that you are more interested in what will happen in the future. I'm the same way.,
Forget about it. I am about to create a new legend as we fight to save the world!,
Eh? People recorded my story in legend and still remember it after thousands of years?,
"May I? If it's convenient for you, would you come to my room tonight? I have so much I want to tell you...",
"Yes, I can be a bit long-winded, and that can be a bit off-putting. Therefore I'm trying to learn to hold my tongue and listen.",

"Exclusive redemption items for Full-Moon events, which can be obtained through events and daily idling",
"The goddes of the East seem to like to live alone, right?",
Eh? ! Is there such a thing? ! Why don't I think so?,
"At least you, who have been in the Guanghan Palace for several thousand years, gave us this illusion.",
,
Oh? Yeah? Then let us take a look at the results of your practice!,
Your rabbit is more fierce than you in a fight... This really surprised me...,
"It is a good tactic to accumulate magic power on the opponent first, and then let the Jade hare detonate.",
Hmm...I prefer to cooperate with Jade hare to defeat opponents rather than protracted confrontation.,
"With such a powerful companion like Jade hare, you can even compete with Nuwa.",
"Nice reminder! I haven't returned to Kunlun Mountain for so long, and I should also go and say hello.",
"Chang'e? It's you? ! Since you left Kunlun Mountain, we haven't seen each other for thousands of years!",
"Is it too boring in the Guanghan palace, so you want to come back to help us end this doomsday?",
,
"Everything is uncertain, after a thousand years of practice, your abilities may have been beyond imagination.",
I think a trial should be the best proof.,
Ah! Stop it! I give up! This powerful explosive force makes me hard to resist...,
,
"Your practice is impressive, and I hope this power can bring peace to the world.",
I will try my best. I am actually very happy to be able to come back to Kunlun Mountain.,
"After all, for thusands of years, my only accompanion in the Guanghan Palace is Jade hare, which is really frustrating.",
"Freyja, you look restless, and you are in trouble again in the war with Greece?",
"On the contrary, the Greek gods have been deliberately avoiding me after they met me on the battlefield.",
,
"Interesting! I probably understand what's going on, boss, what do you think?",
"If you can pass me, I don't mind you, Freyja, to go to Greece to meet the world.",
Stop it! It was just a joke before! I didn't intend to betray my companions!,
"Don't be nervous, dear, everyone from Northern Europe never questions your loyalty.",
This lethality is like a nightmare for opponents whose armor is broken...,
,
"Go and see Hera, I'm looking forward to her expression when she sees you fully awakened.",
"Freyja from Northern Europe... We knew you would come, but we didn't expect to be so soon...",
"Your Excellency Hera, main god of Greece once invited me. I did not intend to miss the appointment.",
"I have been waiting for you for a long time, and I have always wanted to find out how strong a heroine with overwhileming power is.",
"If I win, I hope to suspend the conflict between each other due to the struggle for human faith.",
"No problem, but if you lose, you must be my most loyal guard!",
,
"The outcome is obvious, your excellency Hera, I hope you can fulfill the promise, and I will keep this promise in mind.",
"Northern Europe has the sword of Freyja and the shield of Heimdall, and there is no flaw.",
At least I know very well that this incarnation of war and love is not the same kind of person as me...,

Asura Shard,
Collect 55 Asura Shards to summon Asura,
"Asura is a powerful demon, known for being irritable, combative, and brave. She constantly hones her fighting skill by battling devas at the sacred battlefield known as Shuraba. \nAccording to rumors, Asura is fierce and terrible, always filling her enemies with fear. But others say Asura is so gorgeous that even her enemies fall for her beauty.",
You dare to talk to me? Do you not fear me?,
The carnage of battle that I have witnessed at Shuraba is nothing to me. But love is a more gruesome battlefield. Its horrors can temper any heart.,
"You should know that I'm a shape-shifter. If you ever upset me, I will take the shape of the monster you fear most just to scare you.",
Beneath my terrifying appearance lurks a special soul.,
I should cook something for you. I'm quite skilled in the culinary arts.,
"Until you came along, no one ever spoke to me. But since I met you, my heart is flooded with emotions. I feel like the luckiest goddess in the heavens.",
You... make me a little nervous.,
Have you ever experienced love firsthand?,
"No, no... don't do it!!",
Special... In an even more terrifying way?,
Umm... Will it be safe to eat?,
"I'm lucky to have met you, too.",
Haha! Not at all!,
So there is something you fear..,
Pfft! I'm not afraid.,
"To me, you're terrifyingly beautiful and charming.",
My mouth is watering!,
I only wish we could have met sooner.,
"Very courageous! Fortunately for you, I'm in a good mood today. But in the future, I'd be more cautious if I were you.",
"I have not had a lover, but I have spied on many mortals. Their tortuous emotional experiences inspire me.",
Scared? Good! I suggest you start finding ways to keep me happy.,
"I love your humor. But be careful, or my monstrous soul will eat you up.",
"Don't be so scared! You should never judge a dish--or a person--by their appearance. Give me a chance, and I will dispel the stereotypes that cloud your mind.",
"We should mutually benefit from this relationship. From now, don't hide your troubles. I'm here for you.",
"You must be a powerful person, for you speak strong words. It seems that even my menacing aura cannot dissuade you.",
Haha! Don't you dare share my weakness with others. It's a secret just for the two of us.,
Sooooo pretentious! You better not cry when I break you. I couldn't stand to watch you cry.,
Are you always so good with words? Your witty eloquence stirs me. Maybe our future conversations should be more... intimate.,
"For being so trusting, I will make you meal like no other! First, I'll collect the essence of heaven and earth, and then I'll bake them into the most delicious dish ever made.",
"The time we spent waiting to find each other was but a drop in the ocean compared to the vast expanse of time and ages of the gods. Regardless, the wait was worth it!",

"No one knows how long Eunice has stayed in the maze of Chaotic Realm, but judging from her familiarity with the maze, the time may not be short.Only the Minotaurs clan can search for treasures in the deep maze without getting lost, and Eunice is the elite of the clan in terms of exploration skills.She is talented, and she is the only Eudemon that can find diamond veins hidden in the depths of the maze with her good sense of direction and keen insight.",

"It's you, well... Eunice is about to send the diamond ore to the workshop. If it is convenient, can you help me move it...?",
Um? You are the human you saw last time... It seems that the world is smaller than Eunice imagined...,
"Um, please say something later, Eunice has just discovered a large new diamond vein...",
,
"Woo... the cart that carries the diamonds seems to be broken, if you are not in a hurry, could you possibbly fix it for Eunice?",
"Hey? Are you here specifically for Eunice? Don't worry... No matter how complicated the maze is, I can tell the direction...",
"You ask me how I am related to that one named Eunice? Her hot figure suits my taste!But she blushes and runs away when she sees me, which makes me very upset!",
I heard that a Minotaurs Eudemon named Eunice came! I no longer need to worry about Fenrir bullying me now!,

What do you think of war?,
Which of these Greek gods do you prefer: Zeus or Hera?,
"In war, which is more important: an army's strength or an ingenious strategy?",
Do you suspect an evil force is behind the catastrophe that we now face?,
"Even though I'm not the goddess of fate, countless people still come here eager to learn their futures.",
"If the pursuit of the perfect lover would cost you your wisdom, would you still continue the chase?",
War brings destruction.,
Hmm...Lord Hera,
A strong army can overcome anything.,
I really think so.,
I would like to know my future as well.,
I probably would.,
War brings glory.,
I like Lord Zeus.,
An ingenious strategy can turn the tide of any battle.,
Hmm... It seems you're overthinking things.,
Vision determines destiny.,
I don't think it would be worth it.,
"Yes. Although I'm in charge of war, I want peace more than anyone.",
"She might be more attractive if she could temper her jealousy, show some humility, and act more intelligently.",
"That is my favorite tactic, too! A direct, full-frontal attack by a strong army can trample any enemy into the earth.",
"If so, our troubles are just beginning.",
"Sorry, but I would get into big trouble if I told you your future.",
"Oh, really! So... tell me about this perfect woman for whom you would abandon all wisdom. Who might she be?",
"Indeed, but such glory comes at a high cost. Many lives are lost for such vanity, and I find that unacceptable.",
Ha! You and Lord Zeus do have quite a few interests in common.,
I could tell that you are a mastermind of strategy.,
"Still, I plan to investigate. There are just too many coincidences to be ignored. I must know the truth!",
"And wisdom determines vision, doesn't it? With me by your side, you can control your own destiny.",
"I'm glad to know that you value wisdom above all else, even if body instinctively continues its flirtatious pursuit.",
Our vow unites us. Allow my wisdom and strength to help you find the courage to face your enemies and defeat them in battle.,
"In Greek mythology, Athena is the goddess of war, wisdom, and art. She was born from the head of Zeus, the king of the gods, after he swallowed her mother Metis, the titaness of cunning.\nShe is a fierce and graceful warrior, a brilliant and creative thinker, and a patron of many crafts and skills. She excels at tactics and strategy, always finding a way to overcome any challenge or enemy.\nShe is the embodiment of courage, beauty and wisdom, with a divine power that inspires awe and respect.",

"So as the guards, it's our duty to see you off safely from here...",
"But actually, your methods are not safe enough, are you?",
"Indeed, your combat power and tactics on the battle is extremely impressive.",
"It's always best to break the core of your opponent's team, and I know that clearly as a commander.",
,
Just let us do you a favor. Do you think opening a portal could help you?,
"Athena...?! Gosh, Lord Zeus, am I just dreaming?!",
,
"Time is cruel. Obviously, my wisdom has fallen out of the favor with the gods.",
"No, please. Perhaps we can know you again on the battle, dear.",
"Come on, as the Greek lord god, I cannot wait to see how powerful you are now.",
"Reverse the adverse situation brought by the opponent, and then fiercely lash back at the enemy.",
Don't you feel familiar? It was my most effective tactical strategy on the battle.,
"Hundreds of years ago, the little girl was debonair, but nowadays, she is quite violent...",
"Fortunately, she is the companion of Greek gods, not the enemy.",
"Welcome back, dear. You might be more suited to active on the battle than you thought.",

"Right? Well, I cannot wait to punch you on the head to test that which one is powerful, courage or wisdom...",
I prefer knowing the answer with my punch to guessing something. Watch this!,
I knew you were gonna say that! I'm really confident of my charming!,
Uh... What a hassle! It's better to fight against rivals rather than make vows!,

Where is it... Why am I here?!,
Who are you?! This battle will not be related to any stranger.,
,
"Anything wrong with summon spell, why is this happening all the time...",
"Hum, the new guy? Alright, I just think that this battle is not fierce enough.",

"Ah, an interesting guy, I will remember you, dear.",
"According to rumor, she was originally known at the faun, Pan. She became Capricornus when her lower half permanently transformed into a fish's tail after she jumped into a river to escape a menacing foe.\nFor her dedication and valor in war, she was granted divine power and a place in the zodiac. She is known for her mercy and strong aversion to war. Her divine power can comfort and aid companions.",
This world is more dangerous than I thought. Are humans and gods fond of wars?,
It's said that my neighboring constellations were called away to help fight the gods' war.,
"I'm sick of war, but as a cruel twist of fate, I possess a great power than that turn the tide of battle.",
Well... Is there a girl you fancy?,
Divination is my specialty! Would you like for me to predict your future?,
"If one day you must choose between losing the war or sacrificing me, what will you decide?",
But the trials of war are also a way to develop yourself.,
I have a feeling that...,
"Accept your fate, not bad.",
The power also can end the wars.,
"Of course, have a guess.",
No one yet...,
I wanna predict my love...,
I wanna predict the battle progress.,
I'm not gonna let that happen.,
"Well, I would like to work with you to put an end to these meaningless wars. Would you like that?",
"I always prefer peace, though I admit that I love bonding with you during the harrowing fights on the battlefront.",
I will be very lonely without them. I would love it if you would stay and keep me company.,
That's wonderful! It's important to stick with your friends through the darkest times.,
"Maybe you're right. This war has brought us together. You are always on my mind, and no one could ever replace you.",
"You're right! Used properly, my power can bring salvation to the whole world.",
Why are you always staring at me? Hmm... Are your eyes hinting at something?,
"Really? So tell me please, what kind of girl do you fancy?",
,
"The results say, You are your own worst enemy. ...What's that mean? Did I read it wrong?",
"When that moment comes, you won't need to make that choice. Instead, I will choose for you.",
"I believe in you, for you have always shown a knack for disentangling the knots of fate.",
"A vow is a kind of sacrifice, which means that from now on, we will live by one faith. I hope that our powers combine so that we can create a world worth fighting for.",

What's Michael of this world doing? Is she still working on the dispute with Lucifer and monsters?,
I cannot still figure out if I should give up the hostile relationship between Lucifer and me. I'd better focus on maitaining the stability of the parallel universe.,
I'm so glad to be one of the spokespersons belonging to the seventh domain to solve disasters in every parallel universe.,
"Well, as I know, you have not figured out the concept of the seventh domain.",
Do you believe that the doomsday judgement representing justice will come at some point.,
"When other parallel universes get into the catastrophe, would you allow me to leave here and solve the crisis?",
She always has been so.,
I suppose it should be like that.,
What's the parallel universe?,
So would you like to tell me more about it?,
"Yep, it's a kind of glory.",
It doesn't seem so.,
I don't think so.,
What's the spokesperson of the seventh domain?,
"Nope, I have heard it from you.",
I don't want that to happen. It seems horrible.,
Maybe I cannot bear to part with you.,
"Hmm...It's usual. After all, she and Lucifer are enemies like water and fire at least in this world.",
You are right. We will face the more powerful enemy who can destroy the whole space time together.,
Hmm...Maybe you cannot image that there is another you in the similar world asking me the same question.,
"In a simple word, it is the junction where all parallel universes join together and it's also the place trying to arrange heroes to solve the catastrophe.",
It seems that you have gotten ready to resist the fate and the disaster. May the light of the angels be with you.,
"At least, I promise that I will never forget all the time staying with you wherever I am.",
"What a surprise! I thought that she was gonna stick to her principle of throwing Lucifer into the hell, like she always did before.",
Maybe you are right. An alliance between angels and demons is less likely than the sun rising from the west.,
"Maintaining the stability of all the parallel universes and eliminating all risk factors that will cause the space time chaos, which are the responsibility of the spokesperson.",
Eh? So weird. Did I confuse you with an identical being in another parallel universe?,
"When the doomsday judgement comes, all you'll hear a loud bang that sounds like BOOM! And then all the monsters will vanish forever.",
"If one day we are separated into two parallel universes, I will do answer your call when you come back again.",

What do you think of people who sacrifice everything for love?,
"From the human standpoint, love is something that they can put a price on, isn't it?",
"In love or war, it's wise to strike first. Don't you think so?",
"At this time, it's still difficult for the world to accept the fact that god and humans would fall in love, just because the identity of god is different from that of humans.",
"Was the kid, Cupid, faithful to her obligation before I came to this world?",
Are you fond of artwork? How do you like sculptures?,
How brave they are!,
Maybe that's right...,
I always take the initiative.,
It's definitely a pity...,
She really did a great job.,
I know nothing about the sculpture...,
They're quite naive...,
"At least, I don't think so.",
"Actually, I get used to taking a wait-and-see approach.",
I don't care about identity differences.,
She doesn't seem to do well.,
I'm good at sculpturing.,
"As you say, if he were only mortal, I would bestow the gifts of love and strength upon him for his courage",
"Well, it seems that another trouble needs to handle. Let me reshape people's view of love.",
Really? Would you like to come to my bedroom tonight? It's a great opportunity to show your initiative.,
"Anyway, I still look forward to one day when we all throw off our identity and pursue our true love.",
I'm so surprised! I thought that she would screw up affection affairs in this world with her personality.,
"I've heard that countless artists made sculptures of me, but your artwork is the one that I'm most looking forward to.",
Really? It will be interesting to see how naive you will be when you meet the right person someday.,
"Well, I presume...that's why I choose to be with you in the end.",
"Let me guess...Are you eager to hear my self-revealing words, dear?",
You are more optimistic than I thought...May you be able to change this old world and reshape the relationship between humans and God.,
"Aha...It's met my expectations. If she was qualified enough, I won't be summoned to this world.",

"Your strength is not weakened, so it seems there is a way out of this trouble.",
Let me guess...Did Cupid make some trouble?,
You're right. She accidentally provoked the war of gods between Northern Europe and Greece.,
"Well, that's not surprising...She is still as same as what she was centuries ago.",
"Gosh...Why were you here, your highness?",
"You're having fun, aren't you? Surprised to see me again, honey?",
It's said that you messed up the relationships among the gods from Northern Europe and Greece and almost got them into the fight.,
Absolutely not! I just play a joke on them.,

I heard that Odin has been summoned to this world for a long time,
,
"I thought the Greek Gods will be in a state of disunity, but I didn't expect your excellent command ability.",
Do you think there is an insurmountable distance between God and man after all?,
"From where I stand, warfare is a recreational activity between the strong, do you think so?",
How important it is to become the Supreme Deity,
,
It's not easy.,
I'm afraid so.,
War tests us.,
It's a glory worth valuing.,
"ehh,I'm not sure actually.",
She leads a comfortable life.,
I am confident.,
I don't think so.,
War is a disaster for all of us.,
More of a title.,
"I guess it's time to visit her. Without me as an opponent, life would bore her to death.",
Is that so? It seems that she is as jealous as she used to be. It's literally a miracle that she has not exploded the world.,
"I'm impressed by the man with such wisdom and charisma, which is beyond my cognition.",
"Maybe it is what it is. If there's any difference between human and God, it won't be bad for me to abandon the God identity and become a human like you.",
Your answer reminds me of the wartime before I became the Supreme Deity in Greek. Challenging yet interesting.,
"I'm glad that you regard this glory as something important, which embodies my responsibility and dignity as a goddess.",
,
"Haha, you seem to be better at going along with her than me, is that so?",
"Right, otherwise I won't acknowledge you as the chief ruler of all Gods in Greek.",
oh? What do you think about coming over my room tonight and seeing how intimate we really are?,
"Then what's your plan for ending the disaster, my hero?",
You must have found something more cherishable then the title? Could you tell me what it is?,
You are the first person in ages to be worthy of making a vow with me.,
Thunder Scepter,
"Crafted by the Cyclops, even the most powerful gods will be amazed by its power. Lightning is a symbol of Greek royalty, and this scepter has helped Zeus win countless victories that symbolize glory and dignity.",

Collect 55 Zeus Shards to summon Zeus,
"Zeus, known as the Ruler of Olympus, is the goddess of the sky and thunder, and her power is almost at the peak of the major gods. \nIt is said that she was summoned to this world to compete with Odin for the position of ruler of the gods, but no one knows her real purpose and intentions.",

"Now, dear, what makes you feel that you are welcomed?",
,
"For example, re-determining who's the ruler of the gods, and the ownership of the sea, the earth, and the underworld.",
"I just happened to be a little bored, maybe it's time to test the power of the new awakening.",
It's such a shame that all of you are defeated in 10 rounds...,
It seems that the power of thunder I have awakened is enough to rule the Greek gods for centuries.,
It's insane that your power has not weakened in the slightest...,
"Soon, I guess there would be new changes in the landscape and destiny of this world...",
"You are right, answer me: where is Odin?",
"Zeus? ! This is impossible, I did not observe the fate of your coming to this world!",
"It seems your eyesight are worse than before, Odin.",
"Haven't seen you for so long, don't you think your title of Ruler of the Gods is a little less challenging?",
"This title kinda bores me, you want it back? Come and defeat me.",
"There will be an answer soon, and I'm sure you'll miss the deafening sound of thunder.",
"Shocking, Your awakening power is stronger than it was thousands of years ago...",
"I was surprised too, but I guess it's my fate to own the power.",
"It seems that Pandora's prediction is right, the world is in trouble.",
Yeah? I hope it's better not me who's causing trouble for the world.,
"Who knows, you follow the call and come, maybe it is the savior of the world...",

"How dare you refuse my invitation, no one has ever turned down my invitation! I'm interested in you even more.",
"Then don't hesitate, come and hug me!",
Don't you think that I'm uncomparable in appearance?,
"So you're a serious person, huh? Then I hope that you can be a little more relaxed when you're with me.",
"In that case, how about I becoming your sister?",
"Oh! Are you worried about me? Don't worry, I can't bear to let you down.",

You can take the title of the number one evil god! I will win the battle!,
"Loki, I didn't expect that even you were summoned here, and it's time to end our old grudge.",
"You're a vengeful guy, you still remember the grudge from a thousand years ago so clearly! Then I will fight with you to settle the old grudge!",

Sometimes the responsibilities feel heavy on me.,
I will never stop pursuing the greatest power.,
Never will an evil giant set foot in Asgard as long as I am alive.,
"My Mjolnir brought mighty power to me, but I also fear its powerfulness sometimes.",
It is not only because I killed so many that made me the number one warrior of Nordic Deities.,
I am always wondering what the key to winning a battle is? Strong body or great mind?,
But it is an exceptional glory.,
You are already the strongest warrior!,
Let the giants tremble under my mighty power!,
You are the only one who can control this power.,
That's the best recognition you can get from your enemies.,
Power is the most important thing to have.,
I want to share your burden.,
You must keep the balance between work and rest.,
That will be wonderful if we can have a peaceful settlement.,
This is a godsend blessing.,
"No! It is, in fact, the reflection of your mighty power.",
The key is to have a great mind.,
"You are right. For me, nothing is more important than glory.",
To be recognized by you is the greatest glory of all.,
"Some day, I will eliminate them altogether!",
I hope I will not lose control of my power one day.,
"I am so glad with your recognition. However, I don't want to be seen as a bloodthirsty goddess.",
I am confident in the strength I possess.,
I appreciate your presence. Being with you really takes my edge off.,
Maybe you are right. Taking a break every now and then is a must to reach further away.,
"It couldn't be better if we could settle it peacefully. However, it is impossible to negotiate with those evil and irrational giants.",
"Since I was born, I was granted missions of gods.",
You are right. I would much like to build my prestige on my own power.,
That's a good point! I have to be strong in both mind and body!,
"In the presence of others, I demonstrate only my mighty power. But only before you will I show my gentleness. I hope we can join hands and bring peace to this world!",
Thor's Mjolnir,
"Mjolnir is the strongest weapon of all weapons in Aesir. Its hammerhead is forged with the hardest steel in Asgard, and its handle is made of the body of Yggdrasil. It can smash anything with one strike. No matter how far it flies, it would always find its way back to the holder's hand.",

"The goddess of thunder and power in the Norse mythology and also in control of storms, war, and agriculture.\nShe is the greatest warrior in Aesir with the primary responsibility of protecting Asgard from giants' invasion.\nAlso, She is associated with the protection of mankind, as she often appears as the protector of the mortals.",

"My dear sister, I give you my warmest welcome. The power of Nordic Deities will definitely reach another level.",
Geez! I didn't expect her to be here. I guess my days of fun have officially ended.,
"This new power is a little hard to control. Thor, are you ready to take this quest?",
"I knew if you want to master a new kind of power, you must go through a trial. I am ready. Let's get started! Don't go easy on me.",
"I am curious, as the number one warrior of the Nordic Deities, what kind of new power you have awakened.",
Then let me show you how strong this mighty power is.,
It has been long since our last fight. I will take your title if you lose!,
"Humph, you want to take my title? Bring it!",
You used to spoil my plan all the time. I am surprised to meet you again here. You better not bother me this time!,
"Loki! Stop your pranking things, and then we can be friends. Or you will taste the fruit of standing against me in the future.",
"What a dull guy! It seems we have to rematch once. If you lose, pack your things and get back to Asgard.",
"Thor! As the most powerful Nordic Deities, I have high hopes for you. So, as the test assigned by me, this will be an unprecedented challenge.",
Come on! What I am expecting will always be the toughest trial!,

It is said that the magic cure of the World Tree lay in the depth of the forest.",

Am I dreaming? Where am I...,
"My Lord Hera, this abyss is known as the dreamland.",
Pandora? What is going on?,
"It seems that in pursuit of a long-cherished wish, you opened my Box and unleashed this maze of desire.",
Argh... Why I can't remember anything...,
"Indeed, the Box will steal your precious memories. But it will also give you new powers.",
New powers?,
"You harbor potential. But to grow, you must fight.",
The only way out of the dreamland is through battle.,
"You are right, Pandora. It feels as if something is growing inside me.",
"It will transform you in ways you can't imagine, allowing you to transcend your original state of godhood.",
"Be careful. The dream will also force you to face your true desire, and once you lose control of yourself...",
Something terrible will happen?,
"Your uncontrollable desire will consume you. You will become lost in the dreamland, obsessed with power and unable to wake up.",
I will not let that happen.,
"You seem so confident, but underneath that you are extremely anxious. I can see that in you.",
"Just to be safe, I will accompany you and keep an eye on your progress. Don't let your guard down, and focus on yourself on finding a way out.",
I may need your help...,
"Wise choice. With me by your side, you will not fall into the dark abyss.",
There is still a long way to go until you find the exit to this dreamland.,
"Hera, what brings you into this dreamland? This is no place for the Queen of Olympus.",
"Nyx? Even though this is a land of dreams, I didn't expect to meet the goddess of night.",
"I'm not surprised. If your fates are tangled, you will meet in the dreamland.",
"It seems you are lost in your desire for power, just like me.",
I lost most of my power during Doomsday. I'm afraid I must fight you to get that strength back.,
"Pandora, why was Nyx so strong? I thought she had lost most of her power.",
"In the dreamland, all gods are equal. You can only rely on your own skills learnt in battle.",
Why am I here... Hera? What happened?,
It seems the goddess of night was overcome by her lust for power and has become a victim of the dreamland.,
"Humph, Pandora, that must be your doing!",
Anyone who touches the Box and loses to their desire will end up like that.,
"Nyx, you can regain your power. But if you lose your mind, it is gone forever.",
We need to put our past conflicts aside and work together to find a way out of here.,
... You're right. I'll join you. Now let's get the hell out of here!,
Stop! The hand of justice commands you to stop right where you stand.,
"I am a queen, Nemesis! What gives you the right to be so impudent.",
"Since the beginning of time, all the gods have committed countless crimes pursuing their desires.",
Even your path to the throne was lined with the bodies of innocents. Am I right?,
I cannot deny it. But only power can bring order.,
"Fair enough. If you want to prove your point, we have no choice but to fight!",
No one is innocent in the struggle for power!,
"Then, equity and justice will no longer stand by your side. Let the trial begin...",
Your power is so strong...,
"I never regret my decisions, and I am not afraid to take responsibility!",
"Humph, I guess you're doing it in the name of justice. I will no longer stand in your way.",
"But remember, if you ever betray your principles, I will find you and bring you to justice.",
She just disappeared!? I thought no one could leave the dreamland of their own will. Is she...,
"She wasn't real, Hera. She was a creation of the dreamland.",
"You only met her here because, deep inside, you feel guilt for those who died in your struggle for power.",
"...I understand. But after facing her, much of that guilt is now gone.",
The dreamland helps dispel your anxiety. Only in a clear mind can true power be born.,
I feel the power inside me has begun to grow.,
"However, I feel anxiety building within me as well. It feels like my desire is devouring my soul.",
"It has been a long time, Hera. I didn't expect to meet you here.",
I vividly remember the moment you fell asleep ages ago.,
"It's been so long! I'm ready to wake up. At last, you have come to wake me.",
Do you know how to leave the dreamland?,
The dreamland is created when someone with a strong desire or unfulfilled wish touches the Box. So...,
"Once you have fulfilled your desire, you can find the exit of the dreamland.",
So what do we do? I'm not sure if I know what I want.,
Let me test your heart. Maybe that will reveal your inner desire.,
"That was a good fight. Although it was spontaneous, that quick bout let me glimpse your innermost thoughts.",
"As a queen, you desire the respect of everyone. However, you don't always get your way.",
Your position makes you crave even more power so that you can always have your way. Am I right?,
"Yes, you are right...",
I'm impressed that you confessed your selfishness and arrogance so easily. I wasn't expecting you to do so that quickly.,
I will reduce any burden if that stands in my way.,
I have faith that you can get us out of here. Let us stand together to face what lies ahead.,
"No, I am not like that!",
Hmm... You need to let go of your selfishness and arrogance in order to see your true self.,
You're not mature enough to handle this alone. I will come along to watch over you.,
"Hera, have you come to fight me? We never really resolved our conflict.",
Athena?! The Trojan War is over. There's nothing left to resolve!,
How can that be true if we are both here in this dreamland? Don't both of us still wish to win the Golden Apple?,
Too many lives have been lost over that silly Golden Apple. It was not worth sparking the Trojan War. No one should resort to violence over something so trivial.,
Your words mean nothing to me. There can be only one winner between us!,
... It's over. Our conflicts only bring disasters and strife.,
It is not enough... as long as I am alive...,
"As the goddess of war,you should know that we are mismatched in power!",
...You are right. The outcome of a war is always determined by power. And you are indeed more powerful than me.,
"As the winner of this battle, you deserve my respect, and I will follow your lead.",
It is my honor too. Believe me. I will make good use of your power.,
"As the goddess of wisdom, you should know that peace matters most.",
"...You are right. The outcome of the war has to be peace and unity. If that is not the case, there will be no winner.",
We both want to leave this dreamland. ... Maybe allying with you will be a wise choice.,
"As you say, I will fight for you.",
... I should have known that I would meet you here.,
"Zeus? For you to be here, you must have unfulfilled wishes.",
You are right! But the same must be true for you. It seems like Lady Luck hasn't been on your side either since you are also trapped here.,
Humph...,
"I am not surprised, my love. I know exactly what you want..",
"You want to be respected by the other gods, especially me, the Ruler of the Greek Gods. Am I right?",
I won't deny it. Only one can possess the strongest divine power. Let's settle this by testing your power against mine.,
"You are much stronger than before, my dear. I'm surprised that I lost to you.",
"The war of divine power has ended, and I am the winner.",
I wonder how you gonna use the divine power it brings.,
To rebuild the order of the Greek Gods.,
"If these were the old days, I'd fear that you would cause trouble for everyone.",
"However, I'm not as worried about handing it over to you now. The Greek gods will benefit from the new order you create.",
To conquer all other gods.,
It sounds like you share my ambitions.,
I will follow you until the end.,
"Hera, although Zeus has bestowed divine power upon you, Hades and I don't approve.",
Would you rather I prove myself in combat?,
"The Greek gods need a new order, Poseidon. Don't you think this is an excellent opportunity?",
"Honestly, I tired of this power struggle long ago. But maybe we should settle this with a fight.",
You win! I just hope you're competent enough to lead us.,
I won't allow myself to fail.,
I will hand over the ocean realm. I hope you utilize its power properly.,
I'm tired of fighting. I'd rather spend time at the beach and surf with the mortals.,
"Hades, I am creating a new order for the Greek gods. I need your help.",
"I might be interested. But I would never lend my power to a weakling. Show me your strength, and then I will decide.",
"The new order is really in line with your principles, Hades.",
I will not object if the new order can bring significant benefits to the Underworld.,
"Humph... If I must prove myself, then I'm ready!",
Huh... It seems fate shines upon you this time.,
Make good on your promise. And I assure you I won't let you down.,
I will wait and see...,
"Welcome to the abyss, the cradle of desire and power.",
Chaos? What is the Genesis God doing here? Are you also lost in the dreamland?,
"No, Hera. As the embodiment of order and chaos, I cannot be bound by desire or power. For I created them.",
"Your situation, however, is much more interesting. For you already possess the power you need to defeat me.",
Now I understand why I met you here... I need the acknowledgement of the most powerful deity of all.,
And I can't leave here until I defeat you.,
Is that so? Then let's see what you can do. Show me your power!,
Incredible! Your primordial power is strong! But I won! Victory is mine!,
"Hera, I'm not surprised that you can defeat me with your new power.",
What do you mean? You expected it?,
"According to the laws of creation, this divine power of yours was always meant to absorb mine.",
"This divine power is mighty. Once acquired, none of the Greek gods can defeat you.",
"But this power isn't easy to control, even for you. If you're not careful, you will become its puppet.",
No way...,
"Believe it or not, that is your choice. Be wise so you don't regret your decision, Queen Hera.",
Power is everything!,
Of course. Unsurpassed power is always the end goal of all desire.,
"Don't worry, Chaos. I have the determination and faith to control this divine power.",
I hope so. May your determination and faith guide your future destiny.,
I will never become a puppet of this divine power!,
"At last, you have finally found your way out of the maze.",
"But before you wake up, you must overcome one last obstacle.",
And what is that?,
You will meet her soon.,
"We finally meet, my other half.",
I can't believe my eyes! Who on earth are you?!,
I can feel the divine power of Chaos in her body. I have a bad feeling about this...,
"Even I, the goddess of wisdom, can not penetrate her mind.",
"Is she your evil twin? Your doppelganger? ..... No, it seems to be an evil spirit of this dreamland.",
"Hera, if you are unwilling to accept power that can overwhelm everything, then eventually you will grow weak. Your crown will be a sham.",
The gods will continue to look down upon you. Zeus will eventually leave you. And all that will be left is disappointment and failure.,
"Imposter, you're talking absolute nonsense. My dear, don't waste your time with her.",
"In the name of Queen Hera, attack on my signal!",
Hera... You coward... This is not the end...,
"As long as you hide conceit... and jealousy... in your mind, I will take your place one day... Remember it...",
Is it finally gone?,
"Lord Hera, are you still dwelling on what she said?",
"If I were as alone as I was when I start out, I would have given up before the fight began.",
"But now I have formed strong bonds with each of you, and that has helped dispel the shadows of my conceit and jealousy.",
"So, even though I'm not the most intrepid warrior, I will never become a soulless puppet to my power.",
"Dear, this dreamland experience has really helped you to grow up.",
"As you said, I'll never forget it. Let's go. The exit is close.",

Your arrow is much better than that.,
I think Cupid is better.,
It is a little bit blinding.,
I am not a good singer.,
I prefer the tenderness of the moon.,
Don't be too hard on yourself.,
Don't worry. The love you wish for must be on the way.,
Looks like I have more place in your heart!,
I appreciate your compliment. I am gonna be the one who shine till the end.,

"Alas, is this the dreamland abyss? Looks like someone has been naughty.",
"Come on, Pandora. This is your realm, right? Other gods may have believed your little trick, but not me.",
"You truly have a great perception as a Creator, Lord Chaos. But unfortunately, you are only half right.",
So why don't you tell me what the other half is? My little kitty.,
The other half is that I am not the one who lead you here. This dreamland will only open to those who have strong desires.,
Interesting. But I don't sense any desire of mine.,
"Hehe, obviously, the desire cannot reveal itself. Why don't you ask yourself what you want most in the world? My dear Creator.",
"Well... However, I do think there is one thing I would desire to do, hehe...",
"Geez, why do you stare at me like that? Wait... What're you doing!?",
"Look, the door to other places has opened. It seems that to have fun with you is a good choice~",
I... I yield! Please stop...,
"To be honest with me, little kitty, what is going on?",
"Waah... If you do not come here by your own will, then maybe others have summoned you here.",
Well... Do you know who it is?,
"I don't know. However, the dreamland is connected by will. If the one who summoned you has a strong will, you will meet him or her sooner or later.",
Alas... I don't know that I have such charm. Looks like we have to meet this guy together. Let's hit the road!,
I don't care about all these. Just take me out of here.,
"What a surprise. Chaos, the embodiment of curiosity, doesn't care about it? Is that the sixth sense of the Creator has worked?",
What? What are you saying?,
No...Nothing! I said we'd better go as soon as possible!,
"Lord Chaos? Well, it seems you have been trapped here too.",
"Hmm? You are Icarus, the saint of light. I don't think you are the one who summoned me.",
"Just as you said, it is not me. And I am also finding my way out.",
I see. Did you find anything?,
It seems the only rule here is to battle. You are gonna battle with a serious rival or enemies that you once feared.,
... I see your point.,
"To be honest, I have dreamed of the day competing with you. Come on, fight me.",
That is the power of the Creator... More unfathomable than I imagine...,
"I don't think I have fully used my power since most of it seems lost when I enter here. However, I can sense its recovery after defeating the enemy.",
"So, is that mean this whole dream is actually... a trial?",
We don't know that for sure. Maybe the answer will reveal itself if we continue our journey.,
I hope so. Let's go. The portal to the next level is open.,
Hera? Wait... Something is wrong. I can sense the mighty but somehow twisted power within her body...,
Alas... It seems our queen has encountered some troubles here.,
I guess the power of the abyss has something to do with that... Do you think we stand a chance if we throw caution to the wind?,
"I have no idea. But, at least we can try!",
Finally... I guess that's the power of a high-level god with the blessing of the abyss.,
We'd better be careful. Looks like there are more of these phantoms influenced by the power of the abyss.,
I will never agree to let you take the supreme divine power of greek.,
It is not up to you. Only the survivor of the battle can decide. I don't mind having another war to see who is the strongest.,
"Although I am not interested in the struggle for power, I don't mind having a contest with you, Zeus...",
"Thousands of years have passed. And you Greek gods are still the same, always fighting for power.",
Chaos? Only the strongest can handle the supreme divine power. There is no room to change this ancient rule.,
Ah... Don't get me wrong. I am the one who made this rule. I would not deny it.,
"Then, I suppose you want to...",
"You are right. What took you so long to decide who is the strongest? I should give you all a lesson now, hehe...",
That's the strength of the Creator... I guess even Zeus cannot compete with her...,
What a pity... It seems you are not as strong as I thought.,
"Alas, maybe fate has not granted me to become the master of Greek gods...",
"However, I enjoy the fight with you. Maybe that's what I have been waiting for...",
"Also, if you don't mind, what about joining my team? You can think about rechallenging Zeus after we get out.",
"I think so. I don't have any better options, right?",
"Chaos, the Creator of chaos and order... I am not surprised to see you here.",
It is surprising to see you become more powerful in this dreamland. I think now you can stand a chance to fight with Zeus.,
"I have once dreamed of that, to compete for the supreme divine power. However, it now all feels like empty vanity to me.",
"Ah... I am surprised to hear that. I wonder what has changed your mind, the once power-lusting King of Death.",
"If you want to know, you need to beat me first, hehe.",
"Why... Your genesis power is already sealed by this place, but I still can't defeat you...",
"So my darling, can you tell me your secret now?",
This secret... is related to Pandora's box. I heard that someone summoned you here.,
Pandora has said it too. I thought I would receive a fancy invitation letter from him or her.,
"If you are interested, I heard that the summoner is... a human being.",
"Oh, is that so? I don't remember you being so kind as to give me such important intel.",
Because I am also interested in knowing why she summoned you and how this place works.,
"If you want to know, why don't you join me and we can ask her together?",
Good advice...,
I was wondering why Poseidon and Hades didn't catch up with me. Now I see that they were all defeated and joined you.,
"Ah... My dear, does that make you anxious?",
"Are you kidding? I will not have any fear even facing you, the mighty Creator.",
"I appreciate your courage. If you defeat me, I guess they will recognize your position as always.",
Then we have nothing more to say. Come on!,
"Hehe, I, Chaos, the master of order and chaos, will test your ability myself.",
I guess... I have underestimated your power...,
"What an exciting contest, isn't it? I feel that the stronger my opponent is, the quicker my strength will recover...",
"In this dreamland, all original power will be lost. Only by challenging more and more powerful foes can those power be recovered.",
"And that, it is said that this power can make your wish come true.",
"Well... Unfortunately, I still don't know what I want.",
It's too early to say that. Maybe you can find the answer through the door to the next dreamland.,
"Ah... Well, I hope the answer will be a luxury and comfortable bathtub...",
"Yo, isn't this the Creator, Chaos? Look at all those goddesses behind you. Are you preparing to destroy the world?",
"Stop kidding, Erebus. It has been tens of thousands of years... I wasn't expecting to meet you here.",
"Seeing you here, I guess the summoning has succeeded...",
"Speaking of the summoning, it seems you know something about it. You know the price to summon the Creator, right?",
"Indeed. But as an old friend, don't you think we should first warm up a little?",
"Someone feels lonely when I am not around, huh? Then, let me give you some entertainment...",
"Ahh, is that too much for you? I am gonna bring something more exciting... hehe...",
"Stop, stop... You just won't get out of your fighting way, so violent!",
"So, let's get back to the point. Why was I summoned?",
"If you have an intense obsession, then you can enter this dreamland in Pandora's box, right?",
"Not long ago, I heard a human being had entered here. And I am sure you know her well...",
A human being I knew... You mean...,
"Hehe... Although she is not that powerful in the real world,",
"but in here, she is now more powerful than any gods... We are surprised to see that potential lives in a human being.",
What a problem... Where is she?,
Calm down. You will meet her in no time. Let's go.,
"Finally, you came, the Creator. We have been waiting for you for so long.",
Nyx? Why are you here? What wish could you have?,
"Erebus, Gaia, and I, the three origin gods, all have the same wish: to find our lost divine power.",
But we then get into troubles...,
"Alas... the trouble, I guess, has something to do with that human being, right?",
Yes. That innocent but terrible being guards the final door of this dreamland so that no one can get out of here.,
Interesting. I cannot wait to fight with her.,
The rule of the dreamland is all about the fight over power. My power will become part of your strength if you have defeated me. That might be helpful.,
"Also, if you beat me, you would acquire my power. Am I right?",
"Hehe... But I haven't seen you yield to anyone, right?",
"How about this, Nyx? Even if I lost my genesis power, this kind of battle didn't let you down, right?",
I think you may stand a chance to beat that human being after getting my power.,
I owe you one. I will buy you a drink after all this if you don't mind.,
"Long time no see Chaos, the Lord of order and chaos.",
"Gaia, I am surprised a human defeated you since you and I all share comparable power as the origin god.",
Our original strength means nothing here. The will and obsession in the battle is the primary source of the power.,
"Although you think you don't have any wish, I do sense your bliss for continuous battles.",
Alas... I guess you are right.,
"As a Creator, you are more powerful than anyone in the real world. Maybe your biggest wish is to find one opponent that is stronger than you.",
And that is why I find resonance with that summon spell cast by that human...,
Indeed. And her wish is precisely the opposite of yours: to challenge the most powerful god.,
"Heh... I guess it is meant to be like that. In that case, why don't we bring more fun to this party?",
I think there is no need to continue our battle. I surrender. Your power is way stronger than mine.,
"After getting your strength, I sense that genesis power is returning to me. And... it is more powerful than any time.",
"That's right. Now, your power is so strong that you can even change the rule of this place, which means you can take us away right now.",
"This is a quick fix, but what is the consequence?",
"Once the rule has changed, that human will be alone in this dreamland, wandering forever because her wish can not come true.",
It seems so cruel to let her be trapped here.,
"But if you choose to fulfill her wish and accept the challenge, there is a chance you will lose everything, including your genesis power.",
"Lose everything... Gaia, based on our battle, what are the chances if I am against her?",
"She is strong, strong enough to frighten most of the gods. If I say it is fifty-fifty, what would you choose?",
I will still enjoy this last battle.,
"Hmm, you are still the same, so competitive. All Greek gods will witness this battle together. Wish you good luck.",
I will not take chances on the future of the Greek gods.,
The future of the Greek gods is indeed important. But that poor thing...,
"This ultimate loneliness is the fate she needs to face, just like me in the chaos time before I create the world.",
Wish that fate could lead her soul. The exit of the dreamland is open. Let's get out of this place.,
You finally came. I have been waiting for this moment for so long...,
Alas... I thought it would be you. I have to say you look more charming in that suit.,
"Hmmm... If you think the only thing that has changed is my appearance, maybe you gotta pay for that later.",
"Is that so, my dear? I don't think I have a reason to lose to you... Wait! Is that...",
"You can feel it, right? The similar power in my soul...",
The genesis power!? It is impossible! You don't even have the blood of a god. Why can you have such power in your soul?,
"Never underestimate a human being, the origin god of Greek, Chaos. Are you ready to face the prime of this party?",
Come on. l assure you this will be fun.,
I lose... It seems I'm only flesh and blood after all...,
I am curious why you are obsessed with defeating me...,
"Well... In the real world, although I am the commander of all gods...",
I don't think these gods truly believe I am the one worth following. I doubt myself whether I can bring faith and honor to my followers.,
"I thought by deleting you, I could prove that even though I am a human being, I can be a true leader.",
I did not expect this failure... Why do I lose to you even though I possess the genesis power same as you...,
"In reality, you indeed don't have the best fighting skills.",
"However, what you have is more precious: selflessness, unity value, wisdom, and bravery. Those are the gods' lack.",
"Even if you lose, you are still the leader of all gods till the end of the world.",
... I see. Your words... means a lot to me... It relieves me from my doubt.,
"Humph, that's the person I know! Let's get the hell out of here. I can't wait to soak in the bathtub...",

"Aah, my head... Am I dreaming... Pandora? Why are you here?",
Hehe... Just as I expected. You had strayed into a dreamland abyss.,
Wait! What are you planning? I have a sense that you are pranking me now.,
Why do you say that? My dear Love Lady. This is the place for those who hold strong wishes.,
If you say so... okay... Is it because I swear every night that I will become the most excellent Ambassador of love?,
...Well. That's pretty much a big wish. Good luck with achieving that.,
Alas? I thought you were here to help me with that.,
Me? Of course NOT! I am only a guide. I don't have the time to take care of you.,
How irresponsible! I guess someone needs a lesson from me.,
What? Wait... stop! What are you doing?!,
I yield. I yield! Stop that.,
"Gee, I sense my power is not as strong as before... Tell me, is that your doing?!",
"Well... Definitely not me! Your power is scattered in this dreamland, and you need to find them by yourself.",
You'd better add I will help you to find them at the end.,
"It's late now. My dear, where will we be going?",
How terrible. I found that I have forgotten what love really is...,
Huh? What does this have anything to do with our trip?,
It sure does! The power of a love angel comes from the belief in love. If I already forget that...,
Hehe... Maybe that's a good thing. Your stupid rule of love really f**ked those human beings.,
Hello there... Alas?! Pandora and Cupid?,
You... Why are you here? For an unachieved wish?,
"Ugh... Yes? I forget my real name... I guess if I want to leave here, I need to recall my name.",
"Funny... What about a fight? If you win, I will tell you your name.",
"If you lose, you gonna tell me what love means to you. How about that?",
That's a good idea. Come on!,
Ah... You are tougher than I expected.,
"Humph. So, tell me your opinion about love.",
"Ugh... I really can't tell. But maybe, love is a hazy expectation.",
"Hazy expectation... Well, that is an interesting answer.",
Wait! You really do not intend to tell me my real name? I want to get out!,
"Don't worry, my love. I am not such a cruel angel. I will tell you... after I retrieve my power! See you later~",
I sense that some part of my power is around here. We have come to the right place.,
"Humph? Isn't this Cupid, the little love angel of Rome? Let me guess. You are here to get back your lost power.",
That's right! Don't tell me you laid your dirty hands into my power.,
Indeed. And I am not going to hand it over to you.,
"Then, I guess you are about to suffer a bit!",
Does anyone tell you that your cute face looks so inconsistent with your fighting style?,
You tell me why you are so obsessed with the power of love first.,
Mmm... You don't know what it feels like to live alone on the moon for thousands of years...,
"So, you are going to use my power to summon someone to... be with you?",
"Yeah. She has good archery skills, just like you. My old friends... However, she didn't come here.",
"I really wish to meet her here, even just in this dream.",
But you will always wake up in the end. The dream only brings out more frustration.,
"Maybe yes, maybe no. But at least I can feel love through these longing feelings.",
Longing? It sounds a little bit strong but somewhat sweet...,
"You are about to continue to find your lost power, right? Let me help you then...",
"Cupid, come and fight with me! I am very curious about how the power of love can enhance my fire!",
Gosh... I should know that my power may end up in someone like her...,
Can we just sit down and talk? I can take you to the barbecue if you are willing to give my power back.,
Good idea! Let's take a before-meal exercise!,
Wait! Do you even understand what I said before?!,
I am this close to getting all my clothes burnt. Never and ever will I talk to anyone who can play with fire.,
It's a shame to lose to you after getting such great power.,
"You really underestimate my power. If you don't have deep insights into love, I don't think you can master it.",
"Deep insights? To me, love is overwhelming hugs and hot kisses, burning yourself and the one you love with fire, right?",
"If someone does not accept your courting, just knock her out and take her back to your crib. She will agree eventually.",
What? Why do you look so surprised? That's what love means to me!,
"Before I go mad and knock you out, you'd better get out of my sight...",
"Wait! Bring me with you! I give back your power, and you owe me one barbecue!",
It's freezing... Where is this place...,
I am not impressed since this dream is the product of that Frost Dragon.,
Frost Dragon? Do you mean that cold as hell b***h?,
Don't worry. She is outnumbered.,
"You are Cupid, the angel of love. I know you come here to find your power.",
"Finally, understanding beings. Since you know why I am here, why don't you...",
I am sorry. I will not give it back.,
"See, I know there is no need to talk with her. Let's just fight!",
This is tougher than I thought! You are really good with your ice skill.,
I guess this power is just not mine...,
I thought you didn't care about love since you have seen so many of it.,
"Hehe, on the contrary. God or human, they all put more emphasis on things they don't have or are difficult to get.",
"Though the time is short, your power gives me a sense of warmth. It's just like I am with someone.",
Maybe that's what love feels like. Fleeting but precious.,
I feel comforted by hearing you say that.,
"So, as an apology for your trouble, I will help you to retrieve your lost power.",
I am not surprised to meet you here after what I have experienced.,
"And I am pretty sure I will see you here, standing right behind me.",
"I guess you and I have to fight before I can take my power from you, right?",
"Hehe, that's why I like to talk with smart people.",
"Then, let's fight!",
You are much more powerful than before! And your mastery of my power... much better than my two previous opponents!,
Maybe it is because the thunder is just as random and free as love.,
Don't you think?,
"Humph, I found your disposition quite attractive...",
"What are you implying, my dear?",
You... I didn't mean that!,
"Alas, you look pretty when you blush.",
Let me join your trip to gather your lost power. I would like to see how all these will end.,
Ah... The last guy in the world I wanted to see is here...,
"Humph, you are just a little angel of love. How rude are you!",
"Lady Hera, my dear queen. Love has its own path. Even I can't change it.",
I really need your help in getting the perfect love on my mind.,
"Suppose you are not willing to help me. Then, I will take all your power and change the rule by myself!",
"I have tried my best, but I lost... Is love already abandoned me?",
I wonder what love means to you.,
"Loyalty. It means everything to me. Even though I am the queen of all gods, love is something that only can be shared through two beings.",
"But my love has to face the suspect by all gods, wanting through all the difficulties... It is not fair!",
"On the contrary, there is no love without trials.",
"The troubles you meet when you are in love make love more precious. Just like diamonds, if you want it to shine, you must polish it first.",
Your loyalty to love is precious too. It will reward you eventually in someday.,
...Well. Maybe I don't need your power to change everything if that's the case.,
"Good luck with finding your love, my lady.",
"Well, is that a cute kitty who smells love and breaks into my dream?",
"Freyja! Hands over my power, or I will shoot your head!",
"Alas, we are all goddesses of love. No need to act like that. Would it be boring if I just agreed to hand it over?",
"Fight me, then. That will be more interesting.",
You are confident. But... you have forgotten something...,
What?,
"I am also the Commander of Norse Valkyrie, Lord of the War of Valhalla. Come on! Let's fight!",
"That is a brilliant fight, isn't it?",
I enjoy it very much. I used to think you were just an inexperienced child.,
You will suffer if you underestimate my power.,
"By the way, is there any chance you can join our Valhalla and give up your Rome deity?",
"I assure you that, in our Nordic area, there will be a lot of opportunities for you.",
Maybe. I will consider your offer if I get bored of all these and want to do something serious.,
There seems only one part of my power is out there. Where is it...,
Hmm... You do have good instincts.,
"Enmusubi, the love angel of Yamato? All right, that's the fate that plays tricks on me.",
Your last lost power is in my hand. And I do not want to keep it to myself.,
Really?! That's unusual. I never thought this could be solved so easily.,
But I hope you promise one thing. Don't go easy on me when you can fight with me with your full power.,
"I guess you have wished the same thing as I am, right?",
Your ideas about love and destiny are much different from mine thousands of years ago...,
"But our power is all coming from that ideas. So, now is the perfect moment to prove who is right!",
Interesting. Let's see who can win the title of the most powerful angel of love!,
That's enough. I lost.,
Phew... I feel wonderful to have all my power back. Like I have been reborn.,
"So, are you still trust in your belief in love after all this?",
"Yes, I will insist on going on my path.",
"Then, I will open a special gate for you. Let's see how far your persistence can hold you.",
"Humph, I will not easily be cowed. The challenge only excites my nerve.",
Hehe... I know you will not regret it. Come on. I am looking forward to it.,
No. Love cannot easily be defined. We all have an answer.,
It seems you have learned a lot on this trip.,
"You can't force everyone to have the same answer, but let them feel on their own. And that's what is fascinating about love.",
I will look forward to the day when people can send their own love arrow by themselves.,
"You seem to enjoy yourself much when I am not around, my naughty girl.",
Ma... Mother?! Why are you here?!,
"I heard your speech on love. And maybe, I owe you a lesson about it.",
"You are making jokes, right?",
"Tell me, my love. What is love, really?",
A bit of hazy expectation with longing; It burns like fire but sweet as honey; It feels random and selfish but will last forever.,
Maybe that sounds a lit bit corny. But this is my idea of love now.,
Very well... You have changed a lot. Maybe it is time to give you the title of goddess of love.,
But... You have to beat me first!,
"I win, mother!",
"Hehe... That's what I have expected from you. You have grown fast, faster than I thought.",
At least I haven't let you down... I am always looking for your recognition.,
"When you can stand on your own, I will grant you the peace of Rome's goddess of love.",
Hmm... Does that mean I have to manage all the love affairs of gods?,
Holy... I don't want to sit here all day worrying about their private life!,
"Alas, you will find out then...",

Where am I? Is this a dream? I don't remember falling asleep. Did somebody draw me to this place?,
"Hey there. I am Pandora, the goddess of secrets and curiosity. Since you asked, this is a dreamland. This realm is built by my power.",
"Oh kitty, why did you bring me here?",
It wasn't me! You were lured here when I opened my box. Its magic is forcing you to confront your fate.,
"Fate? I haven't cared about that for a long time. And you think I will take your word for it? Pandora, your actions are bold and foolish.",
"Humph... Your weakness proves you can't control this place. Otherwise, this dreamland would have broken down when I defeated you.",
I told you so! Why does everyone always insult me for no reason?,
This dreamland is connected to your fate and will. Defeating me won't change anything.,
It's like a maze in your mind. Only you can find your way out.,
"My fate and will? For now, I will assume you are telling the truth. You can lead the way, kitty.",
That's strange! Do you see the fire ahead?,
That is the Flame of Origin! Why is something so important here? Interesting...,
Who... Who is there?,
Icarus? Why do you hold this sacred flame?,
This is the last light of our world. I will protect it until I find someone who can take my responsibility. No one with darkness in their heart may approach.,
"In that case, I'm the right person to hold that for you. You may hand that to me.",
"No, I disagree. Though you are the Egyptian god of the sun, you are not the best person to protect it.",
Is that so? Then maybe I can convince you by proving myself in combat.,
Hoo... I am surprised to see that the flame inside you is like the one I hold!,
"My dear, I am the god of sun, the world's greatest flame.",
Fine. At least this flame will be safer in your hands.,
"Icarus, I admire your courage in facing the blazing light alone. How about joining us?",
I would be honored. Now let's get going.,
"Ra, I have been expecting you. Since we are all embodiments of the sun, are you interested in seeing who shines brighter?",
Apollo? The Guardian of Troy and the Lord of Light on Mount Olympus.,
I am the fire that lit the universe and the light to drive away the darkness. And I believe that fate brings us together.,
"If you want to win my approval, you must prove that your light shines brighter than mine.",
You're as proud as they say. Let's see your stuff. Bring it!,
Your power... is much stronger than I thought...,
"Our match doesn't mean anything since we are all stuck here. More importantly, we need to find a way out.",
This is not the place for a God of the Sun to stay. I think you have enough power to break the enchantment of this dreamland now.,
It will be easier if you join us. Don't you think so?,
"Heh! I don't think there is enough room for two suns in one sky. Besides, I have some private matters to deal with.",
"That's a shame. See you then, and... good luck!",
"I sense other familiar gods nearby... Pandora, among the gods I know, who else has been trapped in your dreamland?",
"Hmm... I don't know exactly who else... But, their divine energy indicates that some of them are from Egypt.",
Take me to them.,
Don't bother. I am here.,
Geb? Why are you here? Has fate drawn you here as well?,
It's not like that. Nuit and I are here to protect you. We need to ensure that you can leave this place safely.,
"Despite your good intentions, it is a foolish idea. The only way to open the door to the next dreamland is for Ra to defeat you in battle.",
I see. So the only way forward is for you to fight against me?,
"Yes. And for that reason, I will not be offended by your challenge",
"Then, forgive me, my lord... Let us do this!",
You have grown much stronger.,
"But by defeating me in battle, you have taken some of my strength. It seems that you can only grow stronger by draining the power of the other gods.",
I see. It seems that this is a trial for all of us.,
"We'd better get going. Nuit is waiting for us, and she doesn't have much patience.",
"Geb, why are you here? We are supposed to stay in our dreamland until our lord, Ra, arrives.",
"Open your eyes, honey. She is right here.",
"Hello, Nuit. You look rather comfortable sitting here. Why didn't you seek me out?",
"Sorry! I was worried about you earlier... I see that Geb has found you. So, we can go now!",
"My dear, things are not that simple. We have to fight against each other to open the gate of the next dreamland.",
What? A fight? That's simple enough for me. I will prove myself a worthy guardian to you!,
Why did you do that? Was it necessary to attack with your full strength?,
Strange. I sense my power has grown stronger than before.,
"I think this place has released our hidden power. That's good! The stronger we get, the better chance we have to escape.",
"I see... Then, where to next?",
I sense another Egyptian god behind that door. Who else has come there besides you two?,
It may be Anubis. She is not with us. She came at someone else's request.,
Another god? I think that we've got a problem...,
"My lord, the God of the Sun, I have been waiting a long time for you.",
"Anubis, you are supposed to guard the underworld. Why are you here?",
"Because the new order is coming, my lord. Now, I am serving another great being.",
"Another great being? No one can be greater than the Sun God, Ra.",
"We shall see about that. Have you ever thought about the weight of your own soul, my lord?",
"My soul is powerful, and it can only be judged through battle.",
"Well, it is time to speak the truth. Tell me, my dear, who summoned you to this place?",
"Have you already forgotten her? Your former opponent, the God of Ambition, the symbol of eternal chaos.",
...Apep? That's impossible. I sealed her away thousands of years ago. How did she escape?,
"When Pandora opened her box, its magic began luring gods into dreamlands like this one. Sensing Apep's desire to break free and defeat you, it drew her here for that purpose.",
And she wants to destroy me and steal my power for herself?,
"Well, I see. I now realize why this is so important.",
"However, I don't care if she steals your seat of power or whether you crush her ambitions. I only will follow the the strongest leader.",
"I will respect your choice, Anubis. You shall see who wins soon enough.",
Be careful. We are nearing the final door.,
"Nephthys? Gosh, I really wish Apep hadn't summoned you to be on her side.",
"Hmm, I think her soul is lost in this dreamland.",
"Please, be careful, for she is still dangerous. The dreamland will compel her to attack anyone who approaches.",
Then we will bring her to her senses by defeating and subduing her.,
Ah... My head. I was so close to losing myself entirely. I'm glad you came along and stopped this from happening.,
What happened to you?,
"The last thing I recall is a strong, dark power luring me to open Pandora's box.",
"When I opened it, a dense dark fog clouded my mind, and I blacked out.",
That sounds like one of Apep's spells. Yet another reason to find her and bring this to an end.,
Ra? I am surprised to see you here.,
Amaterasu? I have to say that I am not surprised to see the Japanese Sun God here.,
"If my guess is correct, Apep is waiting just ahead. The place will be filled with her dark power.",
You guessed correctly. Are you here to stop her from stealing your power?,
Yes. Why? Are you planning to stop us?,
"You need to go back. Many gods have tried to stop her, but they all failed. I don't want you to die for nothing.",
This is a personal matter between Apep and me. I need to end this with my own hands.,
"Apep has grown too strong. I fear that if you lose, she will become too powerful. If you insist, let me test your strength first.",
"You are strong, Amaterasu. I will give you that.",
"You seem very determined. Remember, you must be careful. You can't lose to her...",
"If your power is absorbed by her... The world will face a fatal catastrophe, and all the gods will suffer too.",
Trust me. I will not let you down.,
"Hehe... My sister, I have dreamed of the day when I could get my revenge for when you robbed me of my power.",
"Long time no see, Apep. Your annoying voice hasn't changed, just like your unrealistic ambition.",
Did you forget that I am born from the darkness and supposed to consume everything?,
"Light can create everything, but it leaves shadows behind. It's impossible to have a world without my darkness.",
Of course I remember that. But this world has suffered enough from your darkness. You'd better step aside and stay silent now.,
"No! Pandora's Box has given me a chance I've been dreaming of for thousands of years. With all the power I've absorbed, you are no match for me!",
So you think! I shall show you how little power you have.,
"Then, no more talking. Let's fight!",
No! Why?! I possessed so much power... How did you still beat me?,
"Go, Apep. Go back to where you came from and stay there forever.",
"One day, I will be back for you, and I will end you with my own strength!",
We did it! The light is returning to the sky! I think it's time for us to leave this place.,
"I still feel something is wrong... Although the darkness brought by Apep has been dispelled, something dangerous is hiding deeper in this dreamland.",
I have the same feeling too...,
There might be a hidden door ahead. You must be careful.,
I suspect that it's the lingering remnants of Apep's power.,
Then maybe I'm wrong. Are you ready to leave this place?,
"Yes, I want to leave here as soon as possible. After all of this, I need to be more alert in the future. I can't let this happen again.",
"And as for this new power I gained here, I will use it to spread more light and restore people's faith in the sun.",
I'm surprised you found me. I should have known that darkness cannot hide from the light.,
Odin...? Wait! Your soul feels so evil... You can't be Odin!,
"Hehe... Then, who am I?",
Don't waste my time. Let's fight and settle this.,
"I am tired of your little tricks, Odin. ... No, wait! Loki is known for her tricks. You're Loki in disguise!",
"Alas, you have unmasked me.",
Was it you who lured Apep here?,
"Hehe... Keeping guessing, and you may find the truth~",
Fine! I will go to Asgard and learn the truth for myself.,
But I'm not going to stick around and give you any hints. Goodbye for now.,
Wow! She's fast and slippery. It's a shame I couldn't stop her from escaping this dreamland.,
What's really going on with this place? Why do I feel there is more behind all these...,
Hoo... I hope I am overreacting. Let's return to the reality so that I can figure out my next step.,

Where am I?,
What a wonderful surprise. I haven't seen anyone for a long time.,
Who are you? What is this place?,
"I am Pandora, the god of knowledge and mystery.",
"This is a place for people looking for an answer to the unsolved questions deep in their minds. Little girl, why did you come here?",
Hmm... an answer to the unsolved questions...,
"Yeah, think carefully.",
I think I am looking for a pair of wings that could carry me over the storms and the flames!,
"I am surprised that you have come to the answer so quickly. But this is not easy, especially for a half-god like you.",
"However, I happen to know a few residents here who can help you.",
"I can introduce you to them, but first, I want to know whether you are worthy of my help.",
"Stop! Stop!!! You hit me, and it hurts, you stupid girl!",
So am I worthy of your help?,
I admit that I underestimated you. You have my respect for now.,
"Then, lead the way.",
"I will do this for you. But remember, as soon as you have what you want and leave the dreamland, please encourage others to come here as well.",
"Tell them that I welcome everyone to this dreamland, and this is an excellent place to make your dream come true. Will you?",
"Look, the one singing in front is Siren. She knows everything about your dream wings. Go and ask her.",
,
"Hey sister, what song are you singing? It sounds lovely.",
"Oh, thank you. What a beautiful girl you are. Come. Come closer. I can teach you how to sing.",
"Stop! She is trying to lure you. The singing voice of Siren is deadly to both men and women, humans and gods.",
I was so close to believing her words.,
"Pandora, who is this girl?",
"She is Icarus, a phoenix who has lost her way. She is looking for to a pair of wings only a god can possess.",
"Siren, I want these wings so I can fly across the storm and flames.",
"Haha, a human who desires the holy wings; I haven't seen something so crazy thing in ages.",
"Even if I knew where the wings were hidden, I wouldn't share them with you. I'd keep them for myself.",
"Fine. If you are not willing to tell me, it is your choice. Pandora, let's keep moving.",
Wait! I don't think I can let you leave so easily.,
"You smell good, a scent of a doomed ambition. Come, let me take a bite.",
"I don't want to fight you. But if you insist on insulting me like that, I have no choice but to defend my honor.",
Is that what you want? Have you surrendered?,
How did a human obtain such power?,
"If you believe in the light, nothing is impossible!",
"Alright, Siren, you lose. Are you going to continue crying like a baby, or do you want to come with us?",
Take me! I want to join you on your trip and watch these events unfold!,
We are entering the territory of Valkyrie. Be careful of the sky. She will attack you from above while you're not paying attention.,
I see her. Valkyrie is right there!,
What are you doing here?,
"Valkyrie, I am here to ask you to give me some guidance.",
About what?,
I am looking for a pair of wings to help me cross the storms and the flames. Have you ever heard of it?,
I have also craved such wings for a long time... It looks like we'll have to fight each other to decide who has the right to own it! The one who loses must help the winner to find it.,
"I don't enjoy fighting. But if I must, then I accept your challenge",
Enough! You have proven yourself... I am willing to follow you and help you find the wings.,
"Thank you, Valkyrie.",
"I will now take us to the Land of the Angels. If you want to get those wings, you must win their approval first.",
"Gosh, so many lovely girls here. Do you three plan to ask me about your destined love?",
"No, Cupid. I am looking for a particular pair of wings.",
Hmm... Do you mean the Wings of Light?,
Wings of Light?,
It is said that the one who owns this pair of wings and is blessed by three angels can have the chance to become a goddess.,
"So, Cupid, can you give me the blessing?",
"No, I don't bestow my blessings freely. First you must... prove that you are faster than my arrow of love in combat. Fight me!",
"Well, I will prove I am worth it.",
"Stop, Icarus. You have won.",
"Thank you, Cupid. This was a fair fight. I won only through luck.",
"That's fine. I can live with the occasional failure. But, tell me, Icarus. What would you do after I give you my blessing?",
Are you seeking love?,
I... I don't know.,
"Alright, stop teasing her. Bless her and take us to your sisters!",
"As you wish. I, Cupid, bless you, Icarus, in the name of love.",
Come on! Michael's holy church is just steps away. She is a lovely angel. I will talk to her about the blessing.,
Whose holy church are you talking about?,
Lu... Lucifer? What are you doing here?,
Interesting. I don't remember inviting you here.,
Indeed. I saw a bright ball of light in the distance..,
So I came here to see what kind of light it was.,
"I guess you are looking for me, Lucifer.",
"Right... Then, I claim the right to a challenge! If you win, I will give you a blessing on behalf of Michael.",
"King of Hell, I will not hold back. I will show you my strength and my faith!",
Do you yield?,
"Yes, I yield. You are indeed worthy of the blessing.",
I will fulfill my promise.,
"I must say, Icarus. You look more determined and confident after the blessing.",
Really?,
Yeah. It seems that your pursuit of the wings has made you grow.,
"Icarus, welcome. The light of fate has foretold your arrival.",
"Raphael, the angel of wisdom, are you willing to bestow your blessing on me?",
Sure. But I worry the wisdom in my blessing will be too much for you to handle. You must pass my trial first.,
Come. I am more than ready now!,
"Now, am I qualified for your blessing?",
I am surprised by your potential. I will now widen your mind with my blessing.,
"Thanks, Raphael.",
I think I am now qualified to get the Wings of Light with the blessing of three angels.,
"Icarus, our blessings are just the ticket to the next destination. You have to face the dragons, the former champions of the sky.",
"I see. Raphael, please take us to them!",
I sense someone trespassing on our territory.,
"Well, I have to say that I can't wait to set something on fire!",
"Don't rush, my sister. Let me discover their intentions first.",
Stop there. Who are you? Why are you here?,
"Frost Dragon, I am Icarus.",
Icarus? I have heard of you from the spirits of the sky and sea.,
"They say your ambition led you to fly towards the sun, and it burned your wings, sending you crashing into the sea.",
"But the spirits of the sea and sky helped me evade death. Now I want to use my new life to fly even higher. To achieve that, I must find the Wings of Light!",
"So, are you here to ask about the Trial of Dragons?",
"Yes, please light the way for me.",
"Great. Then, I will see whether you can keep up with me!",
"Since you have passed my trial, your wings have been strengthened by both frost and storm. Go. My sister is waiting for you.",
I will let you feel the anger of fire!,
"Queen of Embers, I am ready to accept your trial!",
"I have just defeated you, Ember Dragon!",
"No, it was only luck. I haven't lost yet!",
"That won't be necessary, my sister. By luck or not, she has passed your trial.",
"We will open a gate that goes all the way to the deepest depths of your soul. In there, you will find your final trial.",
Only by defeating it can you leave here.,
It seems we have come to the end of our journey.,
"Icarus, you must be careful.",
Look who it is! An innocent girl who dreams of flying towards the sun!,
So you haven't learned your lesson?,
I am no longer the girl I was. I have the blessings of angels.,
And I have passed the trial of dragons. I will defeat you!,
Then come on and fight me!,
I win! I finally made it!,
Apollo?,
"She's gone. She was just a projection of your mind, a shadow of the real Apollo.",
"When you defeated her, you beat your inner demon.",
Those are the Wings of Light that you sought.,
"Icarus, I am the Wings of Light. Before you become my master, I have one question for you.",
What is the question?,
"There are lots of disabled people in the world. Some are missing hands or legs, and some don't even have eyes.",
"If you give me to them, then they will be healed. But if you take me all to yourself, you will have the chance to become a real goddess.",
Which will you choose?,
I will give you to them.,
I am satisfied with your answer. Your nobility has won you the chance of becoming a goddess.,
"Take this power, and you will become the new God of Light, bringing hope to the world!",
I will not let you down.,
I will take you all to myself.,
"So you are chasing glory, not righteousness?",
"Then, by the rules, you must fight someone else who shares your ambition.",
"Jeanne d'Arc, I summon thee!",
"Icarus, let's have a fair fight!",
"Sure. Jeanne d'Arc, I will let you see what kind of power it takes to become a real goddess.",
I... failed. Victory belongs to you...,
"Alright! Wings of Light, obey me and take me to the sky!",
"Yes, my goddess. I will grant you the power you deserve.",
,
,
,
,
The recovery of everything.,
Let's dance together.,
It should be... pink.,
A sense of longing?,
I don't think so.,
Maybe I will come. Maybe not.,
It's rainy.,
Let's fight each other.,
Maybe red is better.,
Hmm... Love?,
The bigger one will be much prettier.,
I'm sure I'll go!,
"Well, as you said, spring symbolizes blooming flowers, the life that comes back... and love.",
"Sure! I am a great dancer, which part do you want to dance with me?",
Pink... that's the color of the sakura! What are you suggesting...,
"Yes, wherever they are, cherry blossoms always represent the longing thoughts of the wanderers.",
I think so too. Little fan is more flexible.,
"Humph! If you don't come tomorrow night, I won't talk to you anymore.",
Walking in the street under an umbrella with your loved one... So romantic!,
"You seems quite confident. If I beat you, don't become a crybaby.",
The warm and lively red? I think I have to try my best to became brighter from now on!,
"Oh, beautiful love in the story... where I can find one for myself?",
Yeah! And you can slap someone with that. So funny!,
Then we have a deal! I will wear my most beautiful kimono and wait for you there.,

"Master, I think I still feel my bed is too small... My feet always stick out of the bed.",
"Master, please let me hide there. That annoying rabbit is clamoring for gifts again!",
"Ah, master, can I borrow your leg again and let me sleep there for a while? I really like this feeling. Sleeping beside you feels very safe.",

You seem to have me confused with that bunny on the moon.,
"I want to be with you, just like this, until the end of the world.",
"Who do you prefer, Zodiac Tiger or me?",
Are you interested in running? Let's have a race!,
Hmm... maybe... *impish grin*,
Well... I have to work every year too.,
Ahh? You are not Xiyu?,
But this is the end of the world.,
Of course it's you.,
Racing with you? A rabbit? A big no!,
I barely know any of them.,
I think you can slack off from your work from time to time.,
I sure can tell the difference!,
(Remain silent),
Hmm... want to take a guess?,
Sure. Want to take a bet?,
What are you thinking? Your expression betrays your wicked thoughts.,
"humph, why don't you do my job for a day and see how hard it is?",
Of course not! She doesn't have such good figure.,
Then hold me a little longer...,
I think everyone prefers a tender girl like me.,
"Of course you wouldn't dare to race with me, since I am the fastest of the fast.",
It's okay. I have grown a lot stronger. They stand no chance of bullying me!,
"Haha, I can't do that. If I stopped paying attention and I lost count of the days, I'd be doomed.",
Yeah?  I thought you human think all the rabbits are the same.,
(Rubbing) I like to stay with you.,
I am sure it's me! I can see it in your eyes.,
"Well, if you lose, you gotta to take me to a date.",
Are you the human who wish to vow to me? I will accompanied by your side from now on. Remember to come and see me if you got the time!,

... Who am I? Where am I?,
"Well, well, well, look who it is.",
"Himiko, welcome to my territory. Is there anything I can do for you?",
"I... I can't remember who I am. When I close my eyes, horrible images fill my mind. Dead bodies, broken ships, and... blood.",
"It seems that by witnessing something terrible, you have lost half of your soul. And you won't be able to remember who you are with only a few memories.",
"I don't know how you got here. But since you are here, I can offer you a deal. I promise to help you restore your memories, but you must listen to me and do what I say. Do we have a deal?",
I... Okay... I have nothing to lose anyway.,
But... I have to test your ability first. Come! I challenge you to a duel.,
Hmm... It seems your body still retains both its power and at least some of its skill.,
"I don't know how I did it. When I draw my blade out, my body just moves with it, like I have a natural fighting instinct.",
This is good. At least I don't have to worry about protecting you.,
"To find your lost soul, you must first find people you know, like the people you used to rule or the followers you once had.",
"Anyway, let's head to your hometown and see who we can find.",
!!!,
Who... who are you!?,
"Calm down, Nekomata. I am Pandora. Look at who I brought.",
"He...Hello, do you know me?",
!!! Queen Himiko!?,
It's impossible. Queen Himiko died a long time ago. You must be an imposter!,
I think we have no choice but to show her the power and strength of Queen Himiko.,
That blade... Is that the famous blade of Murakumo? So you really are Queen Himiko!?,
I... I don't know...,
"Your queen has almost entirely forgotten her past. To restore those memories, former subjects such as you must remind her of her former glory.",
"So, I will now connect your minds together. Then she can see who she is in your memories.",
"Queen Himiko is the greatest queen of our land, a wonderful queen that cares for her people!",
"Now, seeing how she perceives you, how do you feel?",
I... I don't know. I still can't believe that is me.,
Give yourself some time. Let's head out to our next destination.,
Look where we are! This is the Atsuta Shrine.,
I... I think I know this place. I used to... be in charge here.,
Let's go inside.,
"Stop there! This is a sacred place, and thus a restricted area.",
Look at this woman standing before you. Don't you recognize her?,
"Queen Himi... No, it is impossible!",
You dare to pose as our beloved queen! This is unforgivable!,
That blade technique... It's from the ancient Yamatai. Who are you?,
"Isn't it obvious? This is your regent, Queen Himiko.",
How is this possible. She died thousands of years ago...,
"Then how do you explain me? I, Pandora, a mythical being also stand before you.",
"Your duty, first and foremost, is to serve your queen. Take us into the shrine. Your queen hopes that it might trigger more of her lost memories.",
,
"Alright, let's see what this sacred mirror can do.",
"Queen Himiko is the one who opened our small, isolated island to the wider world. She helped us grow and make new connections with other tribes.",
I... I did all of this?,
This mirror is your possession. It records your life.,
"My dear queen, let's not waste time. We have another guest to see.",
"Queen Himiko, someone has asked to see you.",
"Here we are again, Queen Himiko.",
I remember you! You are...,
"I am Tsukuyomi, the moon god.",
I...,
Say no more. I have already heard of your situation. I came because I want to give you my power to help you recover your memory. But...,
But there is a price behind it?,
"Yes, I need you, Queen Himiko. I need you to perform your duty as a queen to beat Izanami. If she breaks free of her seal, people will suffer.",
I understand. I think my memory is gradually coming back...,
"Good, then, as part of the Yamatai tradition, I must give you a trial. Come when you are ready!",
You did great. My power is now yours.,
"In the eyes of your people, you are their great mother. You bring food, peace, and hope to the lands.",
"But... I failed them. I led them into war, and they all died because of me.",
This is the fate of our people. There is nothing you can do to change it. I will call Princess Kaguya here. She will give you more guidance.,
"Princess Kaguya, bring that Magatama up here.",
"Yes, my lord.",
"This precious jade artifact, the Yasakani no Magatama, stores part of your spirit. As you may recall, you must fight for it.",
"Then, bring it, Princess Kaguya.",
I'd be honored to fight you!,
Our dear queen really lives up to her reputation. What power!,
Your people call you the daughter of the sun because your faith is like fire. I now see why. It is inspiring.,
My faith...I used to have that kind of faith? I vaguely remember...,
"Good, let's keep moving. Your fate awaits.",
"Oh, look who is there.",
Bari? I don't remember planning this meeting,
But here I am!,
I strongly suggest you step aside and don't bother us.,
"Pandora, let me handle this.",
"Alright, my dear queen.",
"Princess Bari, I have heard a lot about you. Why are you here?",
Someone asked me to defeat you. But I have a proposal for you.,
What is it?,
"Let's fight. If you win, then I will have to tell you the truth about who sent me.. But if you lose, you have to come with me.",
That sounds fair. Let's do it!,
What? That blade... the sacred mirror and the jade artifact... How did you manage to find these three artifacts?,
Just admit it. You are no match for me.,
"Fine, you win. But I will not stop challenging you in the future!",
"Now, darling, you promised. You must tell the truth. Who is behind this and why?",
Izanami sent me. She is planning her return.,
I knew it! Why can't she stop coming back?,
"Relax, I will defeat her and seal her away, just as I have done in the past.",
Oh my gosh! Why do I keep running into you?,
"The road you are on ends here. Leave, or die!",
This blade I hold has killed many dragons. You stand no chance against me.,
Then try. Let's see if that blade is as mighty as you say.,
You are much tougher than I thought.,
And your technique with that blade really impressed me.,
"You have won my respect. If you don't mind, let's team up, and I will help you to get out of this place.",
"Ah, what have I found here? A delicious dinner.",
Apep? Why are you here? What evil plot are you a part of this time?,
Shush! Don't cut me off. I am here becasue Izanami promised to let me take charge of all souls in this land if I helped her.,
"She will not succeed, and I am afraid you are no match for me either.",
I am willing to take the chance.,
Did she just disappear? It seems like she was just an illusion.,
I sense that Izanami is about to come. Let's hurry up. We have to stop her before it is too late.,
"Tsukuyomi, my beautiful girl...",
I haven't seen you for a long time...,
Don't try to trick me. You are no mother to me. My mother is dead.,
"And you, Himiko...",
"As the creation of Amaterasu, you are just like her, so irrational.",
"I have collected the three artifacts, and I will use them to seal your power!",
"I dare you to try! I spent all these years in darkness, and no one cared about how I felt. You shall feel my wrath!",
I will not disappear as long as there is hatred in the world!,
,
I think that's why I came back to life.,
My body.... feels different... What is happening?,
Something emerged from Izanami's body...,
"Himiko, I am coming for you!",
You... who are you?,
"I am the other half of your soul, your darkest desires come to life. I am the one who leads our people to ruin.",
No! I don't believe it. You can't be me.,
"Whether you believe me or not, I am the part of you that you so often cast aside. Only when you embrace me will you become whole.",
I will not accept this!,
I will end this and perish with you.,
"This is our destiny, and there is no way to escape it.",
I accept you...,
Come. I've been waiting a long time for this day.,
"You can't do this! If you leave, there will be no one to protect our land!",
"Tsukuyomi, no power will last forever. Someday, someone else will assume my responsibility.",
"No one can shed their dark side. They are bound together, just like the sun and moon.",
She just disappeared. Now what?,
"No, she has just left this dreamland. I think she finally knows what needs to be done.",
And the only thing we can do is pray that she will continue to adhere to her faith back in the real world.,
Wish her luck.,

Spring Sky Lantern,
What is this place? I thought I was guarding the Rainbow Bridge leading to Asgard. Why am I here?,
"Your body is still there, but your mind has made its way to this place.",
"So, Heimdall, what draws you to my dreamland? Or should I ask, what is the guard of the Rainbow Bridge searching for?",
"As I was drifting off to sleep, I was thinking about Ragnarok, and the death of all gods.",
It's foretold that our enemies will rush the Rainbow Bridge on that day. It's the scene of the final fight...,
"In the end, our home will be burnt to ashes by the sword of Surtr, the Fire Giant.",
So you are looking for a way to stop this from happening?,
Perhaps fate can't be changed?,
There must be a way to save Asgard. I can't stand to see it destroyed.,
"Well, then, you have come to the right place! I can help you with that. I am Pandora, the creator of this dreamland. But first, I must test you to see if you're strong enough to survive the journey.",
"Hmm, not bad. Your reputation as the guardian of Asgard is well merited.",
Follow me. I may know someone here who has a solution to your problem.,
Where is my honey? I was promised lots of honey!,
Who are you??? I don't remember inviting you here. And where is my guest? I invited Belldandy to join us.,
"Eh? I thought this garden belongs to Loki. She invited me here, promising plenty of honey.",
Loki? Is she here? It was a probably a trick. This is what Loki likes to do.,
Is she your friend?,
"No, she is my enemy... The greatest one!",
I see. I see. It seems that Loki has kidnapped the person we're looking for. Let's go find her.,
"Stop making so much noise, and give me the honey I was promised!",
This is my garden. And I never promised you any honey.,
You need to tell us where Loki is now.,
"Humph! You expect me to answer your questions when you won't give me any honey? Defeat me in combat, if you have the courage, and maybe I'll tell you where she is.",
Uwah! (Crying),
She... she crying. Did I go too far?,
Don't worry. Her bearskin is thick and strong. Those wounds will be gone within a day or two.,
"Stop your crying! *sigh* And you think we lack courage? Hmph! Now tell us, where is Loki?",
"Alright, alright. I will take you to her!",
This is it. We are here.,
See that shadow standing there? It's Loki.,
"Loki! Loki! It's me, Ungnyeo. There's someone here to see you.",
She is not Loki. The angel standing here is Valkyrie.,
Who are you? And why is Heimdall here?,
"I have the same question for you, Valkyrie.",
You must be an illusion created by Loki! Show me who you really are!,
We are not illusions. Do you believe your eyes now?,
I thought Loki was trying to trick me again.,
"So tell me, why are you here?",
"Loki deceived me! She said I could find clues here about where my sisters had gone. Since I arrived, she's sent waves of monsters and illusions to attack me.",
Do you know where she was headed?,
Yes. Follow me.,
Stop there!,
Sif?,
Oh? Who are you? Why do you know my name?,
"I am Heimdall, and this is Valkyrie. Don't you remember us?",
"I don't know anyone by that name. But if you give back my hair, I will let you pass.",
Hair? What are you talking about?,
"Wow, what happened to her hair? It looks like a lawn eaten by a flock of hungry sheep.",
That must be Loki's doing!,
"Sif, can you tell us what happened?",
"Cut your nonsense. If you don't give back my hair, then I will take yours instead.",
My head... where has my beautiful hair gone?! Heimdall and Valkyrie? What are you doing here?,
"It's a long story. Let's not talk about this now. Why are you here, Sif?",
"Loki, that horrible piece of sh-. She took my hair and bewildered me with her magic!",
"Sisters, I need to find her and get my hair back!",
"Good, we are also looking for her. Come, follow us.",
Wow! What a big garden. There must be lots of bees and honey...,
This must be Freyja's Secret Garden. What is she doing here?,
Who dares to enter my garden?,
"Freyja! It's your sister, Heimdall.",
"Heimdall? You were the one who strangled my son, Baldr!",
I am no killer... Wait. Are you also bewildered by Loki's magic?,
Wait... Who am I? Where am I...,
I... What did I say...,
"Freyja, don't worry. Everything is fine.",
"I was tracking her, and I was so close to catching her... I remember she turned around and smiled at me. And then... That's all I can remember.",
"If you are looking for Loki, take me with you. I need to teach her a lesson!",
"With your help, we will have a better chance of beating her.",
This looks like the realm of the Midgard Serpent.,
"No, that's also an illusion created by Loki.",
What a pleasant surprise.,
Who are you??? I am so confused. Is this my dreamland or Loki's?,
"I have seen you before. You are Medusa, one of the three Gorgon sisters.",
It looks like Loki was right about you. There is nothing you don't know...,
"Since you are so smart, why don't you guess what I'm doing here?",
"Loki must have promised you the power of the Midgard Serpent, and with that power, you plan to beat Athena.",
I'm impressed!,
You should know that Loki never honors her commitments. She lied to you.,
Is that right? Or do you just want me to tell you where she is? Take this!,
This is not your world. Leave now!,
"Loki, that audacious swindler... She managed to pull in helpers from another realm!",
"Don't worry, Sif. We will catch her and lock her in the dungeon of Asgard.",
"Why are we in the land of Frost Giants? Pandora, what happened? Are we still in your dreamland?",
"Yes, but I didn't create this place. Loki did.",
I think she's nearby...,
Don't you know that you are all trespassing? I don't remember inviting any of you here.,
An ice dragon? Do you take this as your home? This is my place.,
Pandora? If it isn't the stupid angel that doesn't even know what's in her magical little box.,
"How dare you call me stupid! Heimdall, let's kill that annoying little lizard.",
Damn! There are so many of you. That wasn't a fair fight! I will come after you when you are alone.,
Finally! She left. Look what a mess she made to my dreamland!,
,
Is that Odin? What's she doing here?,
"Odin? No, you're Loki! I can even smell the vileness of this place! Only she would treat my son's death like a twisted joke.",
"Loki, you can not trick us!",
"I am Odin, the Queen of Asgard. You dare to question my authority?",
She disappeared...,
I told you she was Loki in disguise.,
"Sisters, Loki is around. Be careful.",
"Hehe, look who I am.",
How dare you pretend to be me?,
"Loki, what have you done to my guest?",
"Oh, do you mean Belldandy? Don't worry. I tricked her and led her somewhere else. She's safe there.",
Where is she?,
"Don't be so rude, Heimdall.",
"Don't you want to know how to avoid Ragnarok? Let's play a game, and then maybe I'll tell you how.",
"Since you're so desperate for a fight, I'll give you one.",
Is it fun to fight yourself?,
"Change back to your true form, or I will beat you again.",
I just fell in love with your look. At least let me use it for a while.,
Ugh... Whatever! Tell us where Belldandy is!,
"Oh damn, I don't remember where I hid her. Was it the mountains in the North or the forest to the West...",
Stop playing us! You filthy trickster!,
"Okay, okay. Do you want to know how to avoid Ragnarok? I can tell you.",
I don't trust a word coming from your mouth. Tell us where Belldandy is!,
"Alright, alright. But remember, you asked to see the goddess of fate yourself. No one forced that on you.",
"Well, there she is. I'm leaving now. Until next time.",
Oh? How?,
"Come closer, I will only tell this to you.",
"Okay, I get it.",
"Sisters, let's go back to Asgard. I know how to save our world.",
What did Loki tell you?,
It's... a secret between us.,
"The wheel of destiny turns round and round like a spindle. It reveals everything, including your arrival. You don't have to speak. I know why you are here.",
"Then, please tell me how to save Asgard from Ragnarok.",
Fate is absolute and immutable. That is why it is called fate.,
So it is unchangeable.,
What if I have to change it?,
"As the goddess of fate, I will stop you...",
"Stop! If you change fate, the consequences will be devasting. The world will be destroyed!",
Why should I care about the rest of the world if I've lost my homeland?,
I... I can see what happens if I change the world's fate... There will be no Ragnarok... Wait! What is that?,
"A giant shadow is covering the world... What is that? I can't see through it... Wait, it is ice... The world is frozen!",
Now you see what the world would be like if you changed your fate.,
Are there any other ways?,
"My girl, nothing can destroy your homeland, including Ragnarok. As long as your people survive, there is always a chance to rebuild.",
"I understand. Thank you, Belldandy.",
So what happened? Is it over?,
It is over. I will return to my station to face fate. I will try to pass down our knowledge and culture to my people so that Asgard will be reborn one day.,

"I have met many angels who accidentally came here, none of them fell from the sky like you.",
Who are you? What is this place?,
"Yeah, yeah. I am tired of answering the same question again and again.",
"I'll only say this once, so listen carefully. I am Pandora, the goddess of mystery. This is my dreamland where you can get what you desire the most.",
I... I want to recover my lost power and be able to fly again.,
"I am not surprised. Plenty of angels came here for power. But before you continue your quest, I have a test for you.",
"Hmm, this is the power of the storm. It is strong and overpowering.",
Does this mean I passed your test?,
"Ye...Yes... But remember, I went easy on you this time.",
The wind is telling me someone is nearby...,
Meow!,
A cat?,
"I am not just a cat, Meow! I am the Nekomata!",
I think you have the power of the wind that I am looking for. Hand that to me now if you know what's good for you.,
"Do you mean that Bead of the Wind? No, I will not give you that! That's my precious.",
This bead contains power you can't control. Only the dragon of the storm can use it to its fullest potential.,
"Humph, I don't believe you. If you want it, come and get it yourself.",
Sto...stop (breathing heavily). I yield!,
Take this Bead of the Wind.,
I think my power is partly restored...,
This won't give you enough power to fly again. Let's find the rest of them.,
Lead the way.,
"Wait, are you going on an adventure? Please take me with you!",
Just stop crawling all over me and get off me!,
Meow! I think someone over there is eating something... Let's ambush her!,
I can feel the thunder power that I am looking for.,
,
What!? Where did you come from?,
You have one of my Beads of power. That's how I found you.,
Why are you always eating when I meet you? Do you know you have devoured all the honey in my dreamland?,
Are you here to take my honey from me?,
"We are not... Never mind. Hand me that jar that's creating sparks in the air. Yes, that one with honey in it.",
Over my dead body!,
"I, I don't understand... Why do you want that jar?",
"This jar is used to store thunder, it is called Thunder Grail. I need its power.",
"That's what it is... No wonder why I sometimes felt like lightning was hitting me. Wait a second. Let me finish the rest of the honey, and I will give it back to you. Here.",
I can feel the power of thunder rumbling through my body.,
You have grown much stronger.,
But this is not enough...,
Are you going to find delicious food to eat?,
Is there anything else you care about beside food?,
It is said that rain is the purest water and that it makes the best tea.,
That's why you took my power of rain as your own?,
"I didn't steal that. I took part of it from the Queen of Yamatai, Himiko.",
Where is she? Please take me to her.,
"What? No, I will not betray her. She is an important ally. Unless... you prove your worth by defeating me.",
You lost. Now take us to her.,
"Well, well, well... What's the rush?",
Where am I...,
"Alas, I accidentally got lost...",
I don't remember inviting any of you here... What do you want from me?,
I am sorry. We are just passing by...,
You are strong...,
Hmm? What? Are you interested in fighting me?,
"Yes, you are a good opponent.",
Wait! Why don't you all calm down?,
Not if she insists..,
I lost. You are indeed powerful...,
"Why don't you follow me, and we can become more powerful together?",
What? It isn't polite to say that bluntly.,
There is no need to be subtle about that. I accept your offer.,
Finally... we are here!,
"I am the Queen of Yamatai. Who are you? Goddess of the moon, why are you with them?",
I promised to help Storm Dragon take back her power.,
"Himiko, you have the Plate of Rain. It contains the power of the rain.",
This plate means a lot to my people. I can't give that to you.,
It seems this power doesn't serve me after all...,
"Even if you own it, you can't make full use of it. But if you give it back to me, I will use it to bestow favorable weather to your land once my power is restored",
Really?,
"Then, I will help you to recover it.",
"So, we have the wind, the thunder, and the rain... What's next?",
"By tradition, we must undergo the Trial of Ascension? To start the trial, we must first pay a visit to Xiwangmu.",
Xiwangmu? I happen to know where she is. Let me take you to her.,
You seem lost...,
"I need to remind you. This is no place for fun and games. If you stay here for a long time, you will not be able to return to the world of living.",
"Izanami, how have you been?",
Tsukuyomi? Long time no see. You look more beautiful than ever. What are you doing here?,
I am going to meet Xiwangmu and start the Trial of Ascending.,
"Hmm, a grown-up dragon wanting to start the Trial...",
You must hope to regain your power by passing the trial. Am I right?,
Do you want to stop me?,
"It's rare for a dragon to lose her power, yet come prepared for the Trial of Ascension so quickly.",
"If I take your power before that trial, I would become more powerful than ever.",
"Well, try me.",
It seems that I have underestimated your power.,
"If you want to start your trial, follow the river to the end. And you will find Xiwangmu there.",
"Take care, Izanami.",
"Go, and say hello to Amaterasu for me if you meet her.",
"Storm Dragon, Xiwangmu told me to wait for you here.",
"I have heard of you, the goddess living in the moon palace. Are you here to test me?",
"Yes, if you want to meet her, you must defeat me first.",
Then let the battle begin.,
I can sense your determination through the moonlight.,
It's my honor to fight with you.,
Come. I will take you to Xiwangmu.,
"Wangmu, Storm Dragon is here.",
You may rest now. I will take it from here.,
"Wangmu, I am ready to take the trial.",
"Very well, Storm Dragon. Come closer.",
"This door behind me is where a dragon begins its flight. If you defeat me, you can pass the trial and fly through the door.",
Let's get started.,
I did it! I passed the trial.,
"Yes, you have proven your power.",
But I have another opportunity for you to move further. Are you willing to take a risk?,
I accept your challenge!,
This opportunity is only available to a strong dragon. You will be competing against another of your kind.,
I think you know who she is...,
I'm not interested.,
"Hmm, then go. It is time for the dragon to return to the sky!",
"I will bring about your demise, my dear Storm Dragon.",
"I haven't seen you for a long time. You still love to boast. To me, your wings look as weak as parchment.",
"Did you forget who it was that defeated you, knocking you from the sky?",
You are just a coward who loves sneak attacks. I will show you who is the queen of the sky.,
"Nice try, Ember Dragon.",
"I will defeat you one day! And on that day, I will take everything from you!",
I don't care what you say. Now I am the greatest dragon of all.,
I fear nothing!,

"Pandora, come out. The most famous Dragon is here.",
What?!? Not a dragon again!,
"Oh, give it a rest. We all know that you help everyone who comes here.",
Fine! You don't have to be rude about it. So what do you want from me?,
"Hmm... I know many angels were here before me, seeking their heart's desire. Mine thirsts for power, and I want you to give that to me.",
"Oh? Are you sure I will give that to you? Let's make a deal. You give me what I want, and then I will give you what you want.",
"But first, prove your worth by fighting me. If you win, then it's a deal.",
"You are weak, Pandora.",
"All you got is brute strength, humph!",
"Okay, I will take you to find the power you desire. And you... you need to think about what you will give me in return for my favor.",
"Hey, why did you suddenly stop?",
It just occurred to me that fighting would be be a good way to gain strength...,
Pandora? Who are you with? Why is she looking at me like I'm her prey?,
I think... you may be in trouble now.,
Wa... wait! What are you thinking? I don't want to fight you!,
It burns! Stop!!! I surrender.,
Interesting. Even a weak monster like you can be a source of such strong power in this dreamland.,
"Yeah, this place is like an amplifier. And if you take advantage of it, you can become more and more powerful.",
"I see. In that case, I will challenge many strong opponents.",
Such is the Way of the Dragon!,
Who broke into my temple? A dragon? What are you doing here?,
I think I have found my second opponent. I sense extraordinary power inside you.,
Watch out! Don't meet her eyes. Her gaze turns living things to stone.,
I am not called a dragon just for show. Her petty tricks won't work on me.,
You think so? Let's find out. A dragon statue would be a perfect addition to my garden of stone.,
Big words for a lowly snake. Let me show you how mighty a dragon can be.,
Why does my magic and poison not work on you?,
Real dragons like me have resistance to magic.,
I've never heard of anyone having resistance to magic...,
"If you don't mind, I'd like to follow you so I can try to understand how this works.",
That's fine by me. I'm sure we'll have lots of fun together.,
Wait!,
A human? What do you want with me?,
I finally found you. Prepare to face my trial for the disasters and wars you caused!,
"Don't go dragging my reputation through the mud. I may love to fight, but I have never done what you are accusing me of.",
What about all the towns you burnt? Were those not disasters?!,
"Hah! That is simply me living by the law of nature - survival of the fittest. But if you think you are a warrior of justice, then let us see if your 'justice' can beat me in a fight.",
What a great power you have...,
"I have no interest in the weak, puny human. Challenge me again when you actually have the strength to stop me.",
You...!,
I can't just let you walk away!,
Haha! Then follow me if you wish. I don't care. You can be another witness to my great power... Perhaps you'll even learn something by watching me fight.,
A dragon from Mount Doom? Why have you come here?,
"Don't you know, Idun? I've been eyeing your Golden Apples for a long time.",
How surprising. When did you become a vegetarian?,
"It is just a craving. After all, who could resist the temptation of eternal youth?",
Let's see if you're skilled enough to take a bite out of my apple.,
"Stop! Stop!!! You can have a bite of the apple. You didn't need to burn my skirt, you stupid dragon.",
"Ah, how wonderful to feel the energy filling my body. But... This is not enough. I need to find a stronger opponent to fight.",
No other Nordic Goddesses can stand as your equal now.,
You were an excellent opponent. Do you want to join me and watch as I become the strongest in the world?,
Sounds interesting. Count me in.,
That light is blinding. Who is there?,
"Are you seeking the power of light, dragon?",
Light...? I am not sure.,
But I can sense the strong power inside you. Come and fight with me!,
As you wish.,
"Well... I don't know what you are seeking, but I am now certain it has nothing to do with the light. Your brutal way of fighting is nothing like the elegance of the light!",
I am the embodiment of flame and destruction. I seek only power.,
"I wish you would learn to use your power properly. Strength comes from self-control, not anger.",
Meow! I smell something burning. ...Ahh! Why is my tail on fire?!?,
Monster of Japan? Even a little monster like you can be in this dreamland.... I am intrigued.,
You burnt my precious tail!!! It was my loveliest feature. Apologize to me. Now!,
"Oh yeah? And how are you going to make me do that, little cutie?",
Hisssss!! I'm so furious! Feel the wrath of my claws!,
"Bad kitty! If you try to scratch me like that, then you're going to be in trouble.",
Oops... I made her cry. I swear I didn't mean it.,
You are a big bad dragon! I am going to tell the other goddesses of Japan. They will be coming for you!,
"Run, little kitten, run and go tell them. I look forward to another fight, haha.",
This moonlight is beautiful.,
I don't have the time to admire this kind of thing.,
So all you care about is fighting?,
Yes and no. What I care about is becoming stronger.,
You! Are you the dragon who beat Nekomata?,
"That didn't take long. She's not a good fighter, but she's certainly a fast runner.",
"Humph! I don't care for rude people, but a strong dragon? You are totally my type.",
"If you can appreciate the beauty of strength, then I guess you are also worth fighting.",
You are a strong opponent. I was fooled by your soft elegance.,
"You know there is a saying that appearances can be deceiving, right?",
I will keep your words in mind.,
Hmm... You also have the power to control fire.,
Ember Dragon? You have come a long way.,
"Yes, and I am coming for you!",
Fire is a dangerous power that could devour all living beings. Are you sure you want to fight with me? This will not end well.,
"Since we both understand the risk of fighting fire with fire, bring it on!",
You can't be that powerful in the real world... It seems this place really boosts your power.,
But you still won.,
"Even though I defeated you, I don't feel like this victory has made me any more powerful, unlike my previous ones.",
Your power has already surpassed most of the goddesses. That's why you can't grow stronger.,
But I know I can be more powerful! Are there any other ways?,
There is one way. And only one goddess knows how to do it.,
"But if you fail, you will be trapped here forever.",
My pursuit of power means nothing if I retreat.,
"I will introduce you to one of the Main goddesses of the East, Fuxi. She will tell you the secret of surpassing your limit.",
"The incarnation of flame and war, I have foreseen your arrival.",
Oh? Then do you know why I am here?,
The power you chased originated from anger and impulse. I am afraid you still have a lesson to learn.,
But the trial I offer may provide some insight.,
Let's get started!,
"Unbelievable. Even though I have defeated you many times, here you are, still standing unharmed.",
I feel I have reached my limit.,
This is the lesson you need to learn. An intense flame burns out fast.,
"I still stand because, unlike you, I save my power for regeneration. I am like the grass. Although fire destroys it, it will always shoot up again later.",
,
You will understand it eventually. It takes time.,
,
You are right. I shouldn't act on impulse.,
I believe you will become more powerful in the future.,

I sense the power of rain in you.,
"Do you want to challenge me? But if you lose, you gonna give me a taste of something else.",
"If you win, I will give you the power of the wind, and I will be your maid. But if you lose, you have to be my maid forever.",

"Fine! But you have to feed me! Did I ever tell you what my favorite foods are? Listen, they are dried fish, and fried fish and...",
Do you mean this Fine Jade?,

... Where is she? She said she'd be here.,
I'm sorry for being late. I was dealing with something else.,
I hope it's taken care of because I need your help. You once promised to help find whatever I want. I'm here to cash in on that promise.,
"Lady Frost, perhaps you should tell me what it is you seek. I don't read minds.",
"I have a problem. A thief stole my throne, and I need to reclaim it.",
Hmm... Stealing your throne must not have been easy. Whoever did it must be very powerful.,
"Before we begin our search, I must test your strength. I need to be sure you can handle what lies ahead.",
Try me. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.,
"How was that, kitten? Are you satisfied?",
Get me out of this ice! I can't feel my legs!,
"Finally, I can feel my legs again! All right... So, I know an angel who may know where to find your throne. Let's go see her.",
Nuit! Nuit! Do you have a moment?,
Pandora? What do you want?,
My new client is looking for her lost throne. I was wondering whether you know something about it.,
Frost Dragon? Hah! Does she even deserve a throne?,
How dare you! Explain yourself!,
I think she wants you to prove your strength first.,
"Hehe, I am sure one of the arrogant Ruling Gods took it. I am willing to help you to take it back. But I need to test your power first. I don't want to be on the losing side in this conflict.",
One more helper would be nice. Come on. Let me show you the true power of an ice queen.,
I am impressed. You have mastered the art of controlling ice.,
Now do you think I'm strong enough to challenge even the Ruling Gods?,
"I think so. Don't you agree, Nuit?",
"Of course. But with my help, things would go even more smoothly.",
Are you the ones looking for the Dragon Throne?,
"Let me guess. You 'foresaw it?' I know you're the angel of prophecy, but do you have to show off your skill every time we meet?",
"Well, there is something else important that I saw foresaw. You won't find that throne without my help.",
That's funny. Why should we trust you?,
I trust my own power more than the words coming out of your mouth.,
Are you challenging me? Then what are you waiting for?,
Your power is... incredible. It seems that I underestimated the strength of a Nordic Dragon.,
But I also foresaw this failure.,
Just what we'd expect to hear from a loser.,
"No, Nuit. If you had paid attention, she anticipated all of our tactics. If we had battled her one-on-one instead of as a team, then we would have lost.",
"Hmm... What do you think, Frost Dragon?",
... It wouldn't hurt to bring her along to help.,
"Yeah, I agree.",
"Hail, sister! What are you doing here? You still owe me a fight. Do you remember?",
Ember? Are you stalking me? I told you to leave me alone!,
"Stop, both of you. I need your help. It's for the future of our kind.",
Don't try to tell me what to do. You are not my mother.,
"... Ember, you know we are not supposed to talk about HER. We made promises to each other.",
"So? Who put you in charge? I don't care what you think, and I don't give a shit about you. Come fight me if you dare.",
Who's in charge now? Answer me within 3 seconds or I will freeze you solid.,
"Stop, stop! It's you. I yield!",
"Don't talk back to me again. If you do it again, I will not hesitate to put you in the ice hole for thousands of years.",
"Stop. You have scared her, Frost. Don't forget that she's still your sister.",
Are you also questioning my authority?,
"Ember lost because she was still young. But you and I, we trained together.",
I know you've been here before and gained new power. But your tactical blunders when we sparred together make me question how much you could've improved.,
"I've changed because I learn from my mistakes. Besides, I hold my temper better than the two of you.",
Don't bore me. Stop talking and let's get this battle started!,
Damn. I can't move...,
Are you throwing in the towel?,
"I...... Well, I admit my defeat... for now.",
"Though I don't want to admit it, your performance isn't bad. You lasted a few minutes longer than me, haha.",
Hmph! It seems we have no choice but to stop challenging Frost and listen to her if we want to get the hell out of here.,
"Stop, Pandora. I see you trying to sneak around my domain. What are you up to?",
Your domain? This is my dreamland. I can go wherever I want.,
Did you forget you promised I could keep a part of it for myself?,
"... Never mind. We just want to pass through quietly. You're happy with that, right?",
Uh oh. Someone's about to lose their temper.,
Shh! Do you want her to freeze you again?,
"I see. Trying to avoid looking at me, huh? But maybe I'd like to keep you as stone statues to decorate my domain.",
Not unless you can beat our combined might.,
It seems that your petrification magic is still not as good as the dragon's frost.,
You......,
Let's go. We don't have time to waste on this. Are we close to the realm of the Ruling Gods?,
"Yes, Lady Frost. It's just a bit further.",
Be careful. This is Poseidon's place. She has a bad temper. Even I don't dare to mess with her.,
But she may have the thing that you want...,
Pandora! Are you talking about me? You dare accuse me of having a bad temper?,
I... I... No! You must have heard wrong. The dragons and I are just here looking for something. That's why I've brought them to see you. The mighty god of the sea must know where we can find it.,
What are you looking for? Would it be the Dragon Throne? I haven't seen it. Wait... Are you thinking of stealing mine instead?,
"Stealing? Haha... No, no... That's such a strong choice of words. 'Asking' is a better word. We're asking you to give it to us.",
Over my dead body!,
You better watch your back from now on. You filthy dragons! I will return for payback!,
She just disappeared.,
"If one fails to get what one wants, one will immediately return to reality.",
"To be honest, she was stronger than I thought.",
But not stronger than us.,
Look at her throne. It is not the one we lost.,
Then let's go east. There might be another angel who may have a motive to take your throne.,
"Welcome to the dreamland version of the Land of the Dead, called Yomotsu Hirazaka.",
I can feel that someone powerful is around.,
"Yes, that is the legendary lord of the Yellow Springs, Izanami.",
Who is there?,
"... It is me, Frost Dragon, and my sisters. We are looking for the Dragon Throne.",
I have no interest in exotic treasures or status symbols.,
"But after thousands of years in this dream, I'm dying of boredom. I'll tell you what... Play with me a little and I might consider offering some clues.",
What do you mean by 'play a little'?,
"... Come, let me see if you know how to wield that spear you hold.",
Hehe... That was fun!,
"You can look around in my shrine. If you find anything you like, just take it.",
Really!? Wow!,
"You look way too excited, Pandora. Unfortunately, the throne is not here.",
"Hey, you guys are from Scandinavia, right? Why don't you go ask the Norse god, Odin?",
"That's a great idea! Sisters, we'd better get going!",
"Here we are, the domain of the Nordic Angels, the Asgard dreamland.",
Odin sure enjoys a comfortable home.,
Look at all those beautiful palaces...,
The dragon family? What are you doing here?,
I'm here to find my stolen throne.,
And what does it have to do with me?,
You are the queen of Nordic Angels. I bet you know where my throne is.,
How dare you accuse me of stealing it! I'll teach you a lesson!,
Your strength is beyond my imagination. I would be honored if your kind accepted a place within my palace.,
"Back to the throne you are talking about, I know where it is.",
Where is it?,
But I know of something far better than a throne. Do you want to know what it is? I'll give you a hint: It's far more valuable.,
I am interested. What is it?,
"The courage of your kind has always impressed me. Now, enter the portal in front of you.",
I am sure you will find something more valuable than your throne.,
What is this place? I feel like I'm surrounded by chaos and darkness.,
"Odin, is that you? I'm going to make this darkness swallow both you and your ridiculous palace.",
Apep... I knew we couldn't trust that despicable Odin.,
She and Apep have been fighting for thousands of years in my dreamland!,
... How are we going to get out?,
There is only one way to end this nightmare. We must defeat Apep.,
Sounds like we have a fight to win.,
"Get out of my way, Nordic Dragons. This is between Odin and me!",
... I have no choice.,
"Ahhh! Asgard... Sooner or later, my vengeful anger will be reborn...",
I didn't realize that she could be such a difficult foe.,
"After fighting her, it seems my strength has greatly improved.",
Does your dull throne seem so wonderful now? Or is it power that you truly crave?,
... Is my ambitions that obvious?,
I don't care. All I care is to take back my throne!,
Fine. This is Asgard's Time Gate.,
Think of the last time you saw your throne and this gate will take you there.,

Beautiful and dignified.,
Maybe it's because they fear the one who has it all.,
"Because they haven't met you, the embodiment of both charm and power.",
"It seems that everyone thinks the more charming a woman is, the more dangerous she is!",
"But I would prefer for people to feel admiration towards me, rather than fear.",
"I had supreme power over the whole of Egypt a long time ago, but I never felt happy back then.",
Then I want a taste of love.,
Then I am more certain that avenging my father was the right choice!,
Thank you for reminding me of that. I will try not to let hatred consume me.,
You are the first person to tell me that. Thank you.,
Being recognized like that makes me happy.,
"Being mysterious will prevent the enemy from knowing your next moves! But I don't have to hide in front of you, right?",
"This is a very high compliment, and I like it.",
Is that so? Then they are being narrowminded. My power is used to protect my people.,
Is that so? Well I am confident in both my charm and my power.,
"Are you the goddess Pandora, who guards secrets and knowledge?",
"And what brings the guardian of the pyramid and the king's power, the mighty Horus, to my domain?",
"Ra has gone missing, and chaos has engulfed the Egyptian gods. The Devourer Apep is unrestrained, and darkness is imminent.",
I need to find Ra's scepter and take up her responsibility of maintaining order in Egypt.,
Oh? Your power is not enough to control the Egyptian pantheon. Is that why you need her scepter?,
It is a powerful artifact that can harness the power of the sun and dispel all darkness.,
"Is that so? Since it is so valuable, why should I give it to you instead of keeping it for myself?",
"The reason is simple. Your power is insufficient to activate it, Pandora.",
"Ha, you're quite confident. Why don't we prove it with a show of strength?",
"So, do you believe me now?",
"Alright, I will accept it... for now.",
"Hmph, then get started.",
"Hold on, dear. Let's talk about the details first...",
"Although this place is a dreamland created by my Box, it is the best way to achieve what you wish for in reality.",
"Of course, dreams can also be very, very dangerous.",
They can reflect your deepest fears. Be careful... One such nightmare is here now.,
"Horus, I've been waiting for you for a long time.",
"Heh...Anubis? She's hardly my nightmare... at most, she's a nuisance.",
"Ra has asked me to wait for you here. If you want to obtain her scepter, you must pass my test.",
What is your test? Do you want to fight me?,
"Yes, but that is just the beginning of my test.",
"Do you acknowledge my strength, Anubis?",
"Hmph, great power on its own is not enough.",
"What, are you going to weigh my soul too?",
That's not necessary. Your nobility is beyond doubt.,
But I must follow you and witness you overcome each difficulty.,
"Alright, it seems that even the Goddess of Death has a penchant for peeping into others' dreams.",
Don't be like that. It is not a bad thing to have powerful companions join you on this journey.,
"If she causes trouble, it will be a headache for us.",
"Nephthys, what are you doing here?",
"This is my realm, shouldn't I be asking you that?",
"Well, looking at this situation... I guess you're not here to admire my mummification skills, are you?",
"Actually, you've been invited to this dreamland to be a part of Horus' trial.",
"Is that so? Perfect timing, I was just about to test if I can become stronger in a dream.",
"Alright then, let's fight!",
"Wait! Wait! Hold on. Even though we are in a dream, it still hurts to get hit...",
"You've become much stronger in this dreamland. Interesting, does one grow faster here than in the real world?",
What are you suggesting?,
I am suggesting that I join your team and fight alongside you.,
It looks like some uninvited guests have arrived. You sure do have a lot of enemies.,
It seems that they are still holding a grudge over the past. They will meddle any chance they get.,
Don't give us that look. We are not the same as back then.,
"The Scepter of Ra not only decides the fate of the Egyptian gods, but is also crucial for us angels.",
We can't let it fall into the wrong hands!,
Oh my... that's quite insulting.,
You were once known as the God of Vengeance. I can't be sure that you don't still have that terrible personality.,
The Scepter of Ra is the business of us Egyptian gods. It is none of your concern.,
"Besides, my vengeance was exacted with restraint and fairness, not madness.",
"If you insist on going after the Scepter, you must first pass my test.",
Try me.,
Your strength is not enough to stop me.,
"Horus, you've become much stronger than I expected.",
"I may not be able to stop you, but I can follow you to make sure you don't become what I fear you will.",
"So you mean to keep an eye on me, huh? Well, if you can lend a hand when I'm in trouble, I don't mind.",
"Nuit, what are you doing here?",
My sister Geb was kidnapped by Ra. I came here to find her.,
Have you found her yet?,
"Nuit, what's the matter with you?",
"It seems she's being controlled by someone... Oh no, I should have thought of this. It must be her.",
Who?,
"Phantasos, a goddess who can manipulate dreams like me. But... she is also the creator of nightmares.",
"Indeed I am. And unfortunately for you, you're no longer in Pandora's dreamland... You're in my realm. The realm of Nightmares.",
"Pandora, I believe you and I have some unfinished business.",
I don't care about that... Just release Nuit first!,
"Oh, do you mean this Goddess of the Sky? Nuit, show them your power!",
"Yes, master.",
Ah...,
Horus? What happened?,
Phantasos had taken control of your mind. Geb is probably also under her control,
"That's right, I made both sisters into my puppets. But to think you could escape my control like this... I did not expect that.",
What have you done to Geb? Where is she?,
"If you want to know, follow me deeper into my realm, hehe.",
"Here she is. But I don't think she will recognize any of you, hehe. Not even her own sister.",
Geb!,
Anyone who disrupts the master's plan will have to pay the price.,
"Phantasos, the gods of Egypt have not offended you, have they?",
"It is true that I have no grievances with you, but for Ra's Sun Scepter... Well, you understand.",
"With that scepter, I can finally break free from Hades' control and become the new master of the underworld.",
So you're doing this to get the Sun Scepter. Keep dreaming!,
It is said that only an Egyptian god can activate the power of the Scepter. So I made one into my puppet to use it for me.,
"Now, enough talking.",
"Geb, can you hear me? Geb?",
"Ow, my body hurts. What happened?",
"You were injured, don't move...",
We let Phantasos escaped. Damn it.,
"Don't worry, I believe she will eventually come to us.",
I was wondering why Phantasos is being so sneaky. It turns out she is hiding from you lot.,
Apollo? Are you also here for the Scepter?,
Me? I have no interest in that thing. I am capable of using the power of the sun on my own.,
But I don't trust anyone other than myself and Ra to wield the power of the sun properly.,
So you want to stop me from getting it?,
More like a test. Let me see if you're worthy of such power.,
Your strength is beyond my imagination.,
"You're not bad either, Apollo. I almost lost. If not for my allies' help, I would have lost.",
"Alright, I will acknowledge your capability for now. But be careful...",
"Because the moment I think you are no longer worthy of it, I will take the Scepter from you.",
What a disappointment! I thought Apollo would hold out longer than that.,
I am also disappointed to see you again so soon.,
"Don't get too cocky. You know you're still in my realm, right? I can summon anything here.",
Let's see how you deal with the Sun itself!,
Who's calling me? Horus? What are you doing here?,
,
"Indeed, but even so, she will be as powerful as you think she should be!",
We defeated Ra? This is unbelievable...,
Fighting Ra made me feel... uncomfortable.,
It's just an illusion. Don't dwell on it.,
"Oh well, what a pity...",
"Phantasos, you will pay for this!",
It looks like I get to fight you again. How exhilarating.,
Big words for a loser.,
"Watch your tongue, Pandora. This is my realm, and my power still reigns supreme.",
Hmm? I'm curious to see what you can do.,
"Ah, you... You! The scepter is mine! Sooner or later, I will have it.",
"Stop, Phantasos. This farce has gone on long enough.",
Ra? Aren't you just an illusion that I created?,
"My divine power is omnipresent, even in your realm. Thus I can manifest through this illusion you created.",
What do you want from me?,
Nothing. I have no interest in such a small and pitiful goddess. But your dreamland on the other hand...,
"Horus, come forward.",
"Yes, my Lord.",
I sense your faith in the Egyptian gods. I want to see if you are capable of becoming their leader.,
"And if you prove your worth through my test, I will allow you to wield my scepter.",
I have no desire for the divine power of the Sun. I just want there to be less conflict among the gods.,
So do you want to take my test?,
I am up for the challenge!,
"Very well, prepare for battle.",
"Be ready, for you will face the biggest enemy that I have faced for thousands of years.",
"Awaken, Apep!",
"The Lord of Chaos, Apep... I wanted never to see her, not even in my dreams...",
"I'm surprised, you have passed the test. It's time to hand over this scepter to you.",
I will face my responsibilities with confidence.,
"During the next hundred years, you will act as the leader of the Egyptian gods on my behalf. May the sun bless you.",
"Sorry, I don't think I am ready for that.",
"Alright, perhaps someday you will be able to bear that responsibility.",

New Challenge Available,
Are you Pandora?,
"Yeah, who are you? Based on how you're dressed, I'd say you're from the East.",
"Hmm... If my guess is right, you are Sim Cheong, the Korean peasant girl turned empress from Korean folklore. What do you want from me?",
"My people have contracted a disease that accelerates aging. I have searched everywhere for a cure, but nothing works.",
,
"I'm not a genie, so how could I possibly grant people's wishes? Besides, my help comes at a price.",
"For the sake of my people, I am willing to pay any price!",
I admire your selfless nature and your willingness to sacrifice for the sake of others. You are certainly worthy of my help.,
"However, the dream realm is a dangerous place and what happens here affects your body in the waking realm. Are you strong enough to handle it?",
,
"How about a little test then? Don't worry, I will hold back.",
,
,
"You know... your greatest strength seems to be your shields, so maybe we should find you a few companions. That way you can focus on supporting them while they do the fighting.",
And I have two in mind who would be perfect!,
"Ungnyeo, come out! We need your help.",
Again?! But this dream world is so dangerous. I really don't want to do this again.,
"Last time, we stumbled into a nightmare, and I got beaten up. I don't trust you anymore.",
Don't worry. Didn't you notice my companion? It's Sim Cheong! She's very reliable.,
"Sim Cheong...? Hmm that name sounds vaguely familiar, but I can't quite place it.",
"Maybe a good bop on the head will awaken your memories, you sluggish, grumpy bear.",
No more fighting. I yield! How is your shield so strong?,
"Instead of offense, I channel everything into protecting my companions. ... By the way, Ungnyeo, are you also from Korea?",
"Yes! So that's why I recognized your name. We come from the same place! In that case, I'll help you out this time.",
"Great, I'd love to have you on my team.",
Aren't you Sim Cheong? What brings you to Pandora's realm?,
,
"Hmm... I see what you're up to, Pandora. Are you making a business out of this? Trading your help for favors?",
,
"Alright, but only for Sim Cheong's sake.",
Really?! But don't you always demand a test of strength before agreeing to help?,
"A fight is a given. But I'll help out either way, since she is a dear friend.",
As for you Pandora... let's just say you owe me one.,
"You may have beaten me, but even together, we won't stand a chance against the powerful gods we'll encounter here. Our party needs more strength.",
,
"I believe that as long as we stick together, we can overcome any trouble.",
"You are right, my dear. But we should still take steps to prepare.",
"Fortunately, I have a plan. And it involves a formidable dragon.",
,
"There she is. Let me go talk to her. We used to know each other back when she lived in Asia, before she moved to the Norse realm.",
,
,
I see. So you want me to join you in escorting her?,
We would appreciate that.,
,
What do you want me to do?,
I want to see if you have enough determination to weather my storm.,
Nothing you can unleash will break my will.,
"Despite your feeble frame, your will is surprisingly strong.",
I will protect you on your journey and clear the way for you.,
Thank you very much.,
It seems that Xiwangmu was right. You are indeed here.,
,
,
"Xiwangmu has an elixir that can cure all diseases, but she does not give it to just anyone.",
How selfish! Are you here to stop us?,
,
"And if you do beat me, I will lend you my aid.",
"Dear, what do you think?",
"I will save my people, no matter what difficulties I must face.",
Then let's do this. Your people can't wait forever.,
"Enough, enough. I think we can stop right here.",
Xiwangmu asked me to meet you here and help you just in case you ran into trouble on the road. There are thieves roaming about.,
,
"I wanted to see what was so special about you, that made Xiwangmu want to help you.",
So what are the thieves after? Do they dare try to steal the medicine in Kunlun realm?,
"Unfortunately, they've already succeeded not too long ago. But let's not talk about that now.",
"First, I need to focus on escorting you to the peak of Kunlun realm.",
You finally made it.,
,
,
,
,
"She may have been joking, but I'm not. Let's see if you're worthy of this special medicine.",
"Stop, stop! You have passed the test.",
Then please lead the way to Xiwangmu. We must see her urgently.,
Please follow me.,
,
I see them. Do you need my help?,
"No, I can deal with them on my own.",
Lady Himiko? Princess Kaguya? What are you doing here?,
The same reason as you. We need the medicine of Kunlun.,
Why are you trying to stop us?,
"From what I know, the medicine is very difficult to make, and thieves stole the last batch. We were here first, and we need the medicine more than you. The next one is ours!",
Wait! We can settle this another way.,
Draw your weapons!,
"I can't hold out any longer. Kaguya, I need your help!",
,
Now you'll face me!,
,
"I must get the elixir, or else the whole heavenly realm will face destruction.",
So... Come on!,
,
,
,
"Cheong, I don't think that's an option...",
"You have a kind heart, Sim Cheong. I am very pleased.",
Lady Xiwangmu?,
,
"Sim Cheong, if you want the elixir, you must pass the final test.",
You just said that you are willing to sacrifice yourself for the elixir. Is that true?,
"I know it's hard, but yes. For the sake of all living beings, I am willing to do it.",
"Well then listen closely. To make the elixir, a goddess must pour all of her divinity into it. In doing so, she must face her inner self. Even I have nearly lost myself in this process a few times.",
"If you surrender to fear, you will either lose your divinity or die. That is why the elixir is so rare and difficult to make. Are you prepared to take this risk?",
I think I'm ready.,
,
"...If you succeed, the phantom will be used to activate the elixir instead of your soul.",
"Let's do this. For the sake of my people, I will not have any fear!",
Good luck.,
,
Yes. You put your life on the line and you succeeded.,
This elixir can remedy any disease. Take it and go back to heal your people.,
,
,
I value all lives equally. I... don't want to see others suffer. Is there not another way?,
"Yamato is suffering due to the curse of Izanami, the goddess of the underworld.",
"If she is willing to dispel the curse, then the elixir is not necessary. But Izanami... She is much more powerful than me or any other gods you have met.",
,
,
We will not forget your good intentions.,
,
"I understand. Even if I have to risk falling into the underworld, I will face her!",
,
,
"Kaguya, I already know why you have come...",
"Lady Izanami, whatever the reason for your curse, I beg you to lift it.",
"Souls decay, morality fades, and all life returns to the underworld in the end.",
,
"No, everything happens in its own time. Fate is not yours to control.",
Outsider... Who are you to question me?,
"As ruler of the underworld, I have absolute authority over all lives.",
"Then as a guardian of life, I will stop you!",
"Big words for such a weak little girl. You don't stand a chance! But if by some miracle you win, I will lift my curse.",
"And if you fail, I will take your soul. Do you still dare to oppose me?",
I'm not afraid of you. This ends now!,
What a surprise. Defeated by such weakling...,
,
,
Finally... The suffering will end for the people of Yamato!,
"As for you, outsider, I will keep my eye on you in the future.",
"A soul as pure as yours will surely be delicious. I look forward to the day we meet again, in the underworld, little girl.",

Oh no! It seems trouble has come knocking at my door.,

It's a disaster! Someone stole the moon!,
Did you say the MOON was stolen? That... is quite bad.,

What does it look like? Just a big dog?,
I haven't seen it myself. I've only heard about it.,
We should ask the knowledgable Yamato gods. Maybe they know more.,
"Long time no see, Princess Kaguya.",
Who's there?,
It's Chang'e. What happened to your eyes?,
"I can't see anything... Not the moon, nor you.",
This must be because of the moon's disappearance.,
I-... ah. Oh no! The moon demon inside me is waking up. Get away from me quickly!,
"Calm down, there's no such thing as a moon demon. It's just another side of you, like the dark side of the moon.",
No... I can't control it anymore...,
Then release it. We will defeat it to save you.,
Thank you. I feel better now.,
It seems the moon's disappearance really is affecting people.,

Me? I'm running at the first sign of danger.,
"If you want to stand a chance, you need someone stronger.",
"In that case, I know someone who might help.",
Who?,
"Fire Goddess Zhu Rong! She's the Chinese Goddess of War. And most importantly, she owes me a favor.",
"Well if you're confident you can convince her, I will take you to her.",
Here we are. I brought you to Zhu Rong. The rest is up to you.,
You were looking for me?,
Chang'e? Why are you here?,
Please help! The moon has disappeared!,
The moon disappeared? What happened?,
It was swallowed by the legendary Heavenly Dog. Please help me get it back.,
"I see, but... I have an appointment for a duel, so I can't come with you.",
A duel? Why?,
"Ugh, because I'm bored. I've been itching for a fight.",
Then I will fight you!,
You? Hah!,
Don't underestimate me and my allies.,
I guess I could do with a warm-up.,
Not bad. You've improved.,
Xiwangmu has been teaching me.,
"Xiwangmu has taught you some interesting moves. When I return, I'll ask her to teach me, too.",
So are you willing to look for the moon with me now?,
"Well since gave me a satisfying fight, I wouldn't mind stretching my legs a bit... I'm in.",
"So where to next? Princess Kaguya, what do you know about the Heavenly Dog?",
Not much. But I can take you to someone who is well-versed in this kind of thing.,
Lead the way.,
What a beautiful shrine. There must be a powerful priestess living here.,
She is also very beautiful.,
"Sorry, the shrine is closed today. If you're looking for a fortune telling, please come back another day.",
"Amaterasu, we've come for your help.",
"Princess Kaguya? I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was you.",
What do you need my help with?,
The moon was swallowed by the Heavenly Dog.,
You mean the Heavenly Dog from Chinese legends? The one which devours the sun and moon?,
That's the one.,
"Although I have only dabbled a bit in divination, let me try find it for you.",
I can see... a black beast... but it's too shadowy to make out...,
Let me try... Ah!,
What's wrong?,
"Wait, don't touch her! She's been possessed by something...",
Hmph. I came to get a look at who would dare to spy on me.,
"And who do I find, but Pandora. Are you helping lost children find their way again?",
"You have me at a disadvantage. You know me, but I don't know you. Why don't you reveal yourself?",
Haha that's too boring! Instead I'm going to destroy you all using this body.,
Stop! She's regained her sanity.,
Ouch. What happened? And why do I feel like I was beaten up?,
Well... Someone sneaky took over your body and we had no choice but to fight you. No choice at all...,
Uh huh...,
What did you see?,
I saw a huge beast. I don't know how to describe it. But I did see cats surrounding it.,
Cats? Could it be... Nekomata? But she's too cute to do such a thing.,
Let's go ask her ourselves.,
A-meow-zing! This is so delicious.,
It's even better than dried fish. It was worth it to exchange all the offerings for this!,
What are you eating? Bad kitty! Give it here.,
You're stealing meow food! Hiss! I won't let you!,
"Ow! Stop hitting meow! Here, here, you can have some.",
Wait what's this!? This isn't the moon!,
What meow-n? This is octopus balls!,
Octo- what now?,
Octopus balls! Food! Meow food!,
"How cute! She's protecting her food. I just wanna hug her, she's so cute!",
No hugging! Um... but you can pet meow head. Purr~fect.,
"Stealing meow food was claw-ful, but I will forgive you since you petted meow head.",
Why were you looking for meow?,
We're looking for a big black dog that swallowed the moon.,
"...I know I have a tail and ears, but you do realize that I'm a cat, right?",
Well a divination revealed cats surrounding it.,
That's no reason to grab meow food.,
Hmm. I was with Ungnyeo earlier. She looks like a dog and has a big appetite.,
"We gotta follow any and every clue. Lead the way, kitty.",
"Hum~hum~ Such a lovely day today. Little bees~ Come out, come out, wherever you are.",
Look! That's her.,
Huh!? Why are so many people here? Maybe...to steal my honey!?,
No! I won't let them! I'll run away.,
"Hey, stop, don't run!",
Wah! Why are you chasing me?,
Why are you running?,
You all look scary. I thought you wanted to steal my honey. And Pandora always brings trouble.,
"She looks more like a bear than a dog. Unless the moon is honey, I don't think she's the one who ate it.",
Indeed. She doesn't look like a scary beast. She's actually really fluffy and cute!,
Steal the moon? Steal what moon?,
"The moon was swallowed by the Heavenly Dog. But none of us have seen it before, so...",
"I am a bear, not a dog.",
"If anyone could swallow the moon, it would be dragons! Only they have such a big appetite.",
"But aren't we looking for a dog? A bear looks a bit like a dog, but a dragon looks nothing like it.",
Maybe the Heavenly Dog is not actually a dog. That could just be its name.,
Hmm. That is sound logic. Then let's go find ourselves a dragon!,
We're now in the hunting grounds of Storm Dragon. Will we really be okay breaking in like this?,
Don't worry. Zhu Rong will protect us. Hehe.,
"I will try, but I can't guarantee anything if it gets too dangerous.",
It's okay. Storm Dragon is probably sleeping.,
*ROAR!!*,
Ahhh! What was that sound??,
I have a bad feeling about this... Watch out! Above us!,
You're not my usual prey... What are you doing in my hunting grounds?,
"Sorry, Storm Dragon. We came here in search of the moon.",
The moon?,
"Yes, the moon was swallowed. And we heard from a little bear that maybe a dragon ate it.",
A dragon? Eating the moon? Haha even us dragons don't have such an appetite.,
We have nothing to do with that. Maybe the moon goddess Tsukuyomi knows something.,
"Thank you, Lady Storm.",
"The atmosphere here is strange, it's very cold... Like moonlight on a snowy night.",
That's...,
...,
I don't think she's here to have a nice chat with us.,
Watch out! She's possessed!,
Thank you for bringing me back to my senses.,
"Tsukuyomi, what happened to you?",
"Without the light of the moon, my heart was consumed by darkness.",
Do you know who stole the moon? Was it really the Heavenly Dog?,
"Unfortunately I don't know, Chang'e.",
But if it's a dog that swallowed the moon... maybe... Anubis?,
The Egyptian Goddess of the Underworld? But isn't she the Jackal Goddess?,
Jackals are just desert dogs!,
Sniff sniff~ You don't smell dead. Why have the living come to see me?,
"Chang'e, she doesn't look like the beast I saw.",
What is different?,
She looks... kind of cute...,
...I see what you mean.,
What are you mumbling about over there?,
We're here to find the moon. It was swallowed by the Heavenly Dog.,
The Heavenly Dog? Are you saying I look like a dog? And swallowed the moon?,
Hard to say...,
Really hard...,
How rude!,
I will teach you some manners.,
I'm going to make you spit out the moon!,
"Well? If you want to fight more, I will let the dogs out!",
"Alright, alright. I believe you, you didn't swallow the moon.",
"Although I am also a canine, I don't eat strange things.",
"Well, if it's about swallowing the moon, I might know something..",
There is someone who likes to eat things. Apep the Devourer. She even swallowed the sky of Egypt once.,
"A little while ago, she swallowed something shiny. I guess it's probably the moon.",
Where can I find her?,
Are you sure you want to face her?,
"You have gained much strength during your journey. If she swallows you, you will be reduced to nothing.",
As you wish. I will summon Apep.,
"O all-consuming chaos. In the name of the Guardian of the Dead, I summon you...",
"Well well, if it isn't Anubis.",
It's been a long time. Have you brought me another sacrifice?,
I don't have time for you. They are here to get back what you stole.,
You! Give us back the moon!,
Oh? Are you talking about that big shiny white ball? You'll have to beat me if you want it back.,
"You're tougher than I thought, little girl. I'll return this ball to you. It wasn't that tasty anyway.",
Now the moon can return to the sky.,
Everyone's lives can return to normal.,
"Chang'e, the power of the moon is now within you. You've become the new moon goddess.",
Really? Oh I feel it. I will work hard to light up the night sky for everyone!,
"Very well, I have opened the way back for you. Follow my jackal.",
"So many depend on the moon. I have to get it back, even if it costs me everything!",
You are right. Someone who can swallow the sky is not something I can deal with. I should go back and report to Xiwangmu.,

What's this? A hidden tunnel? I sense lots of treasure. It calls to me from beyond the entrance.,
"Amazing! This tunnel must connect to a secret realm, maybe a long lost kingdom of the gods.",
I am so excited! Let's go and see what we can find there!,
"I'm exhausted. I didn't expect this place to be so big. But look, I found these!",
Wow! These seem to be miracle cards once used by the gods to record the past. Let's take them to Gods' Relics and see if we can repair them.,
We need to collect more pieces to unleash the full power held within these miracle cards.,
Incredible! I wasn't expecting these miracle cards to emit so much power once repaired. I can't wait to collect more of them!,

These pyramid replicas small enough to hold in one hand are made of pure gold. People often wonder if these delicate replicas were concealed inside the mummified remains of pharaohs.,
"It is said that this stone mirror is made of the sacred stone Nuwa used to mend heaven. The exact positions of the sun, moon, and stars are engraved upon it, indicating that the entire universe is contained within it.",
"A dazzling, gorgeous necklace. It is said to be made of luxurious pearls, shimmering gems of the sea renowned for their beauty and rarity. Legend has it that wearing this enchanting talisman will imbue its bearer with an irresistible allure, a radiance so captivating that no man can resist her charms. The necklace was the treasure of Freyja, and she would never go anywhere without it.",
"This elaborate artifact, made from gold and gemstones, is a symbol of protection and well-being. It once belonged to the Egyptian god of kingship. Staring at it may give one the eerie feeling that it is staring back at you.",
This elusive gold cup purportedly has miraculous healing powers and the ability to grant immortality.,
This blessed treasure made of wood and covered in gold is said to contain sacred stone tablets. Its craftsmanship is exquisite.,
"The sword, crafted from the molten lava at the heart of a volcano, was once wielded by the fire giant Surtr, who ravaged his enemies in battle on the Rainbow Bridge. Legend has it that each swing of the sword could ignite parts of the sky, leaving a trail of flames in its wake.",
"Skidbladnir is a magnificent ship crafted by a skilled Nordic dwarf for Freyr, the god of fertility and sunlight. It is capable of carrying all the Nordic gods at once, yet it can also be folded and stored in a pocket. This divine vessel is a treasured means of transportation for the gods, carrying them into battle during the fateful Twilight of the Gods.",
"Forged by Emperor Haotian, it was given to King Yu to support the pillar of the East Sea. It was huge and incredibly heavy, called the Divine Needle of the Settled Sea. In order to enable King Yu and other mortals to move it, the Emperor of the Skies applied a wish-fulfilling spell, which, when recited, could freely enlarge or shrink it.",

Every treasure hunt gives you an opportunity to win the above rewards.,
Key of Life,
Runestones were one of the supreme treasures of the god Odin. Runes written on stone slab harbored great magic and represented natural energy. Spells were created when these runes formed words or short sentences.,
This symbol of life is a cross-shaped magical object made of gold and precious stones. The gods once gifted the pharaohs with this powerful symbol.,
Pandora!,
Gemini? This is a surprise.,
Please help us. Help my sister.,
What's wrong?,
"While I was sleeping, she created chaos among the the Zodiac Signs.",
"And then suddenly, her soul vanished from her body! She hasn't spoken a word since!",
"From the looks of her, she seems to be in a very deep state of sleep.",
Can you help?,
"Yes, but only at a price.",
"To save my sister, I will pay any price you ask, Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge!",
"Hehe, I haven't heard that title in centuries. I'm in a good mood, so I'll help you.",
"However, I must first test your strength to see if you're strong enough to survive the Dreamland. It's one of my rules.",
"You handle yourself well in combat, especially for someone controlling two bodies with one soul.",
That actually pushed me to my limits.,
"I see. Maybe Pisces will have some insight. After all, her zodiac sign is also a twin.",
Pandora...? You must have a lot of free time to be wandering around in other people's dreams.,
Don't joke around. I'm actually pressed for time. My acquaintance needs your help.,
...,
Gemini?! You're not welcome here after the havoc you've sown.,
"Please, it's not what you think. There's been a misunderstanding.",
"Either leave now, or I'll kick you out by force.",
Pandora... why are you helping her? She almost destroyed the entire Zodiac!,
"I promised to help her. We made a deal. Now, will you let her finish what she was saying?",
"...For your sake, I will listen.",
"Pisces, what happened wasn't our intention. My sister lost control and things got out of hand.",
"And afterwards, her body became like this. As if she'd lost her soul.",
"My suspicion is that someone is manipulating her. Pisces, you are both twin signs. Do you have any idea what may have happened to her?",
"...I am not sure. Unlike Gemini, our two souls share one body, and neither one of us has ever lost control.",
"But I do know someone who might have an idea. Capricorn was once the goddess Pan. She once tried to change into a fish, but got stuck as both a goat and a fish.",
"Capricorn? If she still has Pan's memories and powers, then she might be able to help.",
"Long time no see, Capricorn.",
"Sister, it is good to see you.",
"This is the goddess Pandora, and these two... Well, you know them.",
Gemini? Why do I sense a horrible aura around her?,
You really are the most perceptive of all the Zodiac Signs. Can you see what's wrong with her?,
"Her soul is stained by something, but it's too hazy to see what is causing this influence.",
"If I draw on my power, would that amplify the influence and allow you to see the cause more clearly?",
That would work. And the best way to do that would be through battle.,
The evil energy seems to be coming from the underworld.,
"The underworld? Is it Hades then? But she hasn't meddled in the affairs of the gods for a long, long time.",
"She doesn't care about that stuff. Regardless, it seems we'll need to pay her a visit.",
Where are you going? It's not polite to break into other people's dreams without consent.,
"Sorry, but we have business we need to attend to.",
Business? Like pruning my roses?,
Hmph. That's something your servant should do.,
"Even after all this time, you still think so little of me?",
I don't like moody goddesses like you.,
"In that case, why don't we make a bet?",
"If you defeat me in battle, I will forgive your rudeness and I will even help you attend to your business.",
"But if you lose, then please take good care of my roses.",
You'll regret those words! You're on!,
It seems that my rose pruning will have to have to wait for another day.,
"However, I always keep my word. So what is this business of yours?",
"My lady, my sister seems to be under the control of a power from the underworld. We want to ask Hades.",
"Hades does not like intrusions from the likes of us. If you want to see her, you will need to find someone who can fight.",
Might I suggest Athena? She is a good candidate.,
Athena. Finally. It took us quite a while to find your dream.,
Pandora? And Queen Hera? I am surprised the two of you are together...,
And... Gemini? What's this? It looks like the Dark Twin has lost her divinity.,
"Goddess of War, can you see what's wrong with my sister?",
Do you wish to wake her up? I don't advise it. There seems to be an unsual energy sealed within her.,
"But if it continues like this, I am worried that she will hurt others again.",
If you're just worried about her hurting other people... I have a solution for that.,
What solution?,
Make her sleep forever.,
!!!,
That battle confirmed my suspicions. She is a huge threat...,
"Athena, this unkind temperament of yours needs to change.",
I'm being honest and rational. Understand that I believe only logic and reason can maintain the order of this world.,
Oh no-one is going to want to marry you at this rate.,
...,
"Anyway, you guys won this time.",
Don't you have some business to settle with Hades? Would you like to come with us?,
"...She mistakenly registered a soul from Athens under the name of Sparta, our enemies!",
"Hmm... Well, I know someone who can open the way to the underworld for us. Her name is Medusa.",
But I heard she doesn't like to talk to others.,
"It doesn't matter. As her old friend, I will make her talk.",
"Medusa, come out! Or I will fill your temple with mirrors!",
Athena... It's you again. Your presence always ruins my dreams.,
"If you do something for me, I promise you can continue your sweet dreams undisturbed.",
...Are these two enemies? Are we about to fight?,
It's a long story. Get ready.,
"Guess it's not my lucky day. So, what do you want from me?",
Open the door to Hades' dream for me. I have a score to settle.,
Heh... I thought so. What a bothersome request.,
"Alright, the gate to the underworld is open. Stop bothering me now.",
Thank you.,
"Go, before I change my mind.",
"Ugh. Phantasos, Hand of Hades, Apostle of Nightmares. The last person I wanted to see.",
"Well I don't like you much either, Miss Bad Luck.",
"But unlike Hades, I can bear with your bad temper.",
"It's not good to talk about her behind her back. After all, the entire underworld is her eyes and ears.",
"By the way... Light Twin, your sister seems to exude underworld energy.",
Does it look like she's getting worse?,
"It's hard to say. Although she has the underworld energy, the source isn't necessarily Lord Hades.",
Can you help us?,
I'm really interested in the energy in her... How about leaving her here and letting me study it?,
I'm dying to find a way to surpasss Lady Hades in power.,
"Hah! Even after so much time, your ambitions are still as big as ever. Come and take her, if you can!",
Open your eyes wide - see my nightmare!,
Such a pity... Your nightmares don't affect us.,
How can this be...?,
"Darling, this is my Dreamland. Your powers are limited here.",
...I'll let you go this time. But I won't hold back when we meet next time!,
Phew! We made it out of there safely. She's a dangerous foe. And who knows what other dangers lie ahead.,
I hope my sister can pull through this safely.,
"The dream is getting more and more blurry. Pandora, are you sure everything is still under your control?",
This is a bit strange... And I don't sense Hades' power.,
How rare! A visitor.,
Izanami? What is a Yamato goddess doing in the dream of the Greek goddess Hades?,
"As master of the underworld, wherever death is, I am too.",
"Since you are lucky enough to visit my Dreamland, how about staying for a chat...",
"Sorry, we are in a rush.",
"So rude... Next time, politely accept my invitation to chat and we won't have to fight.",
Let's take our leave first. We have someone more important to meet.,
"Yes, let's keep going. It seems that the temple of Hades is up ahead.",
Pandora? You finally came back to see me.,
"No, this isn't about coming to see you. I'm here to help Gemini as part of an agreement.",
"Either way, you'll still have to ask me for help.",
Enough chitchat. What is with the underworld energy radiating from Gemini? I bet that you're behind it... again.,
What do you mean again? What have I ever done to you? ... I've never... Wait... What is...?,
... How interesting. There is a new power growing inside this little one's body.,
"And once her metamorphosis is complete, she will become a new ruler of the underworld alongside me, Izanami and Anubis.",
What are you talking about? She'll never...,
You don't believe me? Let me use the true potential of the power within the body of the Dark Twin and show you.,
"This power... it's amazing, but it's also terrifying. ... This is the first time I have felt like this...",
"When this new power in the Dark Twinness awakens, you will gain infinite power.",
Do you not wish to have great power to protect each other?,
I... just want things to go back to the way they were. I want a peaceful life with my sister!,
"I respect your choice, but you'll regret it once I interrupt this process to wake her up...",
"Dark Twin, Twin Stars of the Zodiac. Heed my call, awaken from your slumber...",
Sister? Are you... awake?,
Sister! Why are you messing with my plans?! Everything I'm doing is to create a world where you can be happy!,
"Have you forgotten how weak you are? Unlike me, you were born a mortal. I can change all of that!",
None of that matters! I'm happy as long as you are by my side.,
"If you destroy your soul... then what's the point?? Even if I had the whole world, I'd have nothing without you!",
You have always been so weak. I will have to show you the meaning of power!,
Why can you just accept my plans?,
"If I have to trade my sister's life for that, then I don't want it at all!",
"I... understand. It seems that even if I have the power of Hades, I still cannot defeat you. What is truly powerful is your love for me.",
"Oops I hate to interrupt such a touching scene, but...",
"Since you are unwilling to sacrifice your sister, I have no choice but to take back the energy in her body.",
"However... After the trials you've faced in the Dreamland, perhaps this newfound understanding can make you both much stronger.",
"As much as I hate to say it, I owe you my thanks, Hades.",
"Alright darling, you got what you wanted. It's time to talk about what you owe me.",
You're right. Power is the only way to protect her...,
A wise choice. The underworld is looking forward to a new ruler. The advent of a new world is just around the corner...,

Shadow Echo,
"Pandora,stop hiding! I know this is your Dreamland.",
"My, my, Freyja of Asgard? What a surprise.",
I need a favor.,
"Straight to business? I like that. So, what do you need?",
Odin is missing again. I'm sure she's off somewhere having a good time again...,
But Asgard cannot remain without a ruler for long. So I need you to help me find her.,
"Sure. But, as per my rules, you must first pass my test of strength.",
"So many rules... Fine, let's do it.",
"So, did I pass?",
There is no doubt about your strength.,
Good. Then let's come up with a plan for retrieving Odin.,
"Odin is the most powerful of the Norse Gods, right? If we want to make her return, we will need more than just the two of us.",
You just worry about finding Odin for me. I will take care of finding strong allies.,
"Heimdall, Guardian of Asgard and the Bifrost, I have business with you.",
"Freyja, what brings you to me?",
"Where did Odin go? You know all who pass through the Bifrost, so you surely know her whereabouts, right?",
"I'm sorry, I promised Odin that I would not reveal her whereabouts.",
You must understand that Odin's absence puts Asgard in great danger.,
I cannot break my oath.,
Is your honor more important than the safety of Asgard?,
...Perhaps there is a way I can help. But you will need to defeat me in battle.,
I will use any method necessary to ensure Odin's return to Asgard.,
You fought well. It seems your strength is greater in the Dreamland.,
"That was too easy. You didn't fight with your full strength, did you?",
"...I am now your prisoner, and as such, you can order me to advise you when you are going in the wrong direction.",
"I see. So as long as you don't directly lead me to the correct path, you will not be breaking your oath? Let's go!",
"As you command, my lady.",
"Freyja, where are you going?",
Thor? Did Odin send you to block my way as well?,
"Odin? I am also looking for her. She agreed to a duel with me and Valkyrie, but she never showed up.",
That is so like her. Join me - I will find her and make her return to Asgard.,
"I will join you, but... First, I want a warm up battle. After all, I don't want to lose my duel later.",
"I was just thinking it's easy to talk to you, but I guess we still have to fight. Alright, I accept your challenge.",
"It is an honor, Lady Freyja.",
"Do you still want to continue, Thor? You have already lost.",
"Hmph! I concede... this time. I've warmed up now, so let's go find Odin!",
This is Valkryie's dream. We can ask her to help search for Odin.,
"Be careful. I heard she recently lost a duel, so she's in a bad mood.",
Who did you say lost!?,
Gods! Are you a ghost? Make some sound when you walk!,
You think I'd lose? Fight me and see.,
Are all Norse gods so... reckless and carefree?,
...Don't get the wrong idea about us. It's just hotheads like them that like to talk with their fists.,
So?,
It was a tie! Don't you dare think you won.,
"Alright, alright. If you two want to fight again, let's get Odin back quickly so you can have your duel.",
...Odin is missing again?,
Why would we be here otherwise?,
That looks like Sif up ahead. What is she doing here?,
She seems to be searching for something.,
My hair... my golden hair. It's gone!,
What are you talking about?,
Did you steal my golden hair?,
Isn't your hair on your head?,
Give me back my hair!,
You're as tough as ever. That was a difficut fight.,
Ow... Why does my body hurt?,
Huh? Did you forget you just attacked us?,
"...A few moments ago I met Loki, but I can't remember what happened next. She must have done something to me.",
"Her again! Next time I see her, I'm going to grab her by the horns and saw them off!",
I don't think you will have to wait long. Odin leaving is the perfect opportunity for her to stir up trouble. She wouldn't be able to resist.,
"Loki, I know you're there! Come out!",
I was going to surprise you guys. I didn't expect you to find me first.,
"You're always up to no good. Be honest, where is Odin?",
Oh no... Odin is missing... Such a pity... But I have no idea where she is.,
Your words don't match your expression. I guess we will have to beat the truth out of you!,
Hmph. It seems that your power is greater than I thought in this Dreamland.,
"It's time for you to confess, sweetie.",
"Forget about that. Since we're old friends, I will help out just this once.",
"I don't know where Odin is now, but she was with the Nordic dragons earlier.",
The dragons? I have a bad feeling about this.,
Goddesses! I challenge you! I will defeat you one by one to prove that I am qualified to inherit Odin's divine right.,
...,
"How impudent! If we weren't in a dream right now, your heads would roll for this.",
Unfortunately not. Since Odin has promised that the strongest will inherit her position as Supreme Ruler of Asgard.,
"Is that so? Well then, do you two plan to come at us together? Or...?",
Hah! I alone am enough to deal with you all. Bring it on!,
Impossible! How could you have such strength in my dream?,
"If you've lost, sister, step aside. Let me show them the difference in strength.",
Does the cold temperature here remind you of home?,
"Since you already know that we aren't afraid of the cold, do you still think you can beat us with a little snow?",
My power is no ordinary snowstorm...,
I told you so. We Asgardian Gods have lived in the Nordic ice for thousands of years.,
"I acknowledge your strength. But unfortunately, I don't think Odin will go back to Asgard with you...",
Why not?,
"Because I am tired of ruling, my dear.",
Odin! So you really were hiding in Pandora's Dreamland. Do you have any idea what is happening to Asgard?,
"Nope, no idea. But since you are all in one piece, I believe you have everything under control.",
"You really are shirking your duties... Asgard is weakened without a leader, what if those warmongerers from Greece come looking for a fight?",
"Ah I just want to relax. Besides, I have already announced how my successor will be chosen, haven't I?",
"Sorry, but we don't agree with your rash decision.",
Asgard cannot be without your wisdom. So if you insist on staying in the Dreamland...,
We will have to do this the hard way.,
Hehe... I like it hard.,
"...You're serious about leaving. Then we will give you a hard time, my lady.",
"Not bad, Freyja. Your strength has grown much faster in the Dreamland than I could have imagined.",
You have displayed such strong determination. Perhaps Asgard will have a brighter future in your hands.,
Stop saying such ridiculous things.,
"Since ancient times, the Norse gods have always respected power and glory. And your strength has now surpassed mine.",
Maybe it is time for you to become the new leader of Asgard.,
I am not the best candidate though...,
Asgard does not need a single ruler to make decisions for all. But rather someone to lead the collective voices and wisdom of the gods.,
I have long wanted to change the ruling system. The fate of all cannot be determined by one person's will.,
"Although I am strong, my stubborness and prejudice is not good for Asgard. But you can bring new hope to the gods.",
"If you really think I would be suitable to lead Asgard, then I will undergo the Trial of the Guardian.",
I am certain you won't let me down.,
"When the trial begins, you will see a vision of Ragnarok and will have to face the end of Asgard.",
"If you can defeat my worst enemy, Loki, then there will be no doubt that you are worthy to lead the Norse Gods.",
I understand. I am ready.,
"Be careful. Although it is an illusion, she carries my divine power and is as dangerous as if this were the real Ragnarok.",
"As fate would have it, we made it through Ragnarok.",
"Well done. Asgard will usher in a new era, and all will have a say in its future.",
"I will accept this duty, along with this new power.",
"No, age-old traditions should not be changed.",
"Well if you insist, then I will continue to rule Asgard. At least, until you change your mind...",

"Yo, who's this here? Another lost and confused goddess looking for a guiding light?",
"Pandora, the Greek Daughter of Misfortune? What wind brought you here?",
"Rather than me coming to you, it is you who have strayed into my Dreamland.",
"Let me see which one we have today... Frigga of Asgard, Nordic Goddess of Flowers and Love?",
I heard you are a troublesome one to deal with. How many people have been intoxicated by you? How many people have suffered heartbreak because of you?,
That is all in the past. I am not the same now as I used to be.,
"Oh yeah... Now I should be calling you Queen of Asgard... But why do you look so troubled, Your Majesty?",
"I may be Queen of Asgard in name, but do the other gods even recognize my authority? My reputation in the North used to be quite bad...",
"I want to improve my relationship with the Asgardian goddesses, but I don't know how.",
"Improve your reputation? Well it's your lucky day! I've become rather good at granting wishes, heh.",
"I suggest you go to Freyja. If you can reconcile with her, then the others will probably trust your determination and resolve.",
Really? But I've heard a lot of people say that your help comes at a price...,
Hehe... We can talk about the price later. Let me see your ability first.,
"After all, only those with a strong will and combat ability can traverse my Dreamland without fear of getting lost...",
"The outcome is clear. I am confident in my combat abilities, aren't you?",
...I am starting to understand why you're in conflict with the other Norse goddesses... You really are quite dangerous.,
"Well, I have a good estimate of your strength now. But Freyja will not be so easily persuaded.",
You will need some more companions to back you up. Is there anyone you suggest?,
"Well since you asked, I think Loki would be a good choice. She always comes up with the most interesting and unique ideas.",
Oh my gods... You really know how to pick them...,
"Loki, are you there?",
"I know you are here! If you don't come out within 10 seconds, I will smash this place to pieces!",
I believe she is hiding. Where does she usually like to hide?,
She likes to shapeshift into random things... Ah! The fire was still burning in her hearth!,
Ouch! Let go!,
"Sure enough, you changed into fire.",
It's pointless to find me! I won't listen to you! I won't do what you want!,
...,
She is running away! Quickly! Catch her!,
"Lady Frigga, please let me go! I promise I will never appear in front of you again!",
...What terrible things have you done to the Goddess of Deception? She's shaking like a mouse in front of a cat.,
Enough please. What do you want from me? Let me go and I will do anything!,
I want to reconcile with Freyja.,
"Can't you ask me to do something easier? I don't think it's possible for you to reconcile. After all, everyone knows what your personality is like...",
That's why we came to find you. Lady Frigga has high expectations for you.,
"Ugh, I'll give it a try. But I'm not happy about it...",
"This is the door to Thor's palace. If you want to reach Asgard in this Dreamland, you must pass through here.",
"The door is locked... Loki, you will have a way, won't you?",
,
Loki! You troublesome pest... Haven't you had enough of the pain of being beaten up from last time?,
Wait a second... Frigga? What are you doing here? Why are you with Loki?,
"Don't worry about that, my angel. I want to reconcile with Freyja. Loki's just here to help.",
So her help is calling me names in front of my own palace?,
Well... You see... That's because it's the only way to wake you from your drunken nap.,
"Since it's you asking, Frigga, I have no reason to decline. But...",
"Heh. You want a fight, right? Go ahead.",
"Okay okay. Let's call it here. I admit defeat. I have to say though, your fighting style is... much gentler than before.",
"I am a queen now, after all. I can't be as rough as I used to be.",
"Anyway, I agreed to accompany you to Lady Freyja's dream, but we may run into some trouble on the way.",
Trouble?,
"Yes, because we will have to pass through Valkyrie's dream. She isn't as easy-going as I am.",
"Frigga, I did not invite you into the barracks of the Valkyries. If you take one more step, I will make you regret it.",
"Leader of the Valkyries, you should remember Frigga's status. She is Queen. Show some respect.",
And where was the respect when she treated us like shit?,
I apologize for my past actions. That is exactly why I want to see Freyja.,
"Let's settle this with a fight. If you win, I will let you pass. If I win, you shall not pass!",
"I accept your challenge! But if I win, you will also come with me.",
You will have to beat me first!,
"Phew... Thor, I'm beginning to understand why you're helping her.",
"To put it simply, she is the most important existence to the Norse Gods, other than Lady Odin.",
"Before she was queen, she wasn't exactly a fair and honorable person...",
"But during this battle, I glimpsed her sense of honor.",
"We are warriors. We are duty-bound to obey our liege's orders. Even if she commanded my sacrifice, I would not complain.",
Perhaps you're right... Alright.,
"I will not betray your trust in me, Valkyrie.",
Frigga?,
Sif?,
I didn't think you'd be able to find me even in a dream. So who's the unlucky one you're going to mess with this time?,
I need to see Freyja. I want to reconcile with her and patch up my relationship with the other Asgardian gods.,
"That's not going to be easy. After all, you were rivals in the fight for the throne...",
"That's why I came to you for help. Regardless of other people's opinion, I know you will have my back.",
"Unless you are strong enough to defeat Heimdall, the Guardian of the Bifrost, you will not be able to cross that rainbow bridge into Asgard.",
Wanna see for yourself if I am?,
Of course. I wouldn't want to go all the way there for nothing.,
"This is not like your old powers, Frigga.",
"With your help, I believe that we can handle Heimdall.",
Ugh I do hope that mudsclehead understands your intentions.,
"Stop. Beyond this point is Lady Freyja's palace. I can let you go no further, not even if you are the Queen.",
I wish to give her my greetings and an invitation to reconcile.,
"Is that so? I heard that you are holding a banquet, with the intention of repairing bad relationships",
You heard correctly.,
I see. But I must still abide by my duty to keep Lady Freyja safe.,
"If you can defeat me at half my power, I will consider it your victory and let you pass.",
"Thank you for understanding, Heimdall.",
"You have won. I will not hinder your passage any further, but please be careful.",
"Rest assured, my intention is not to cause issues. But to resolve them.",
With all due respect... what is Loki doing here?,
Well... she is a valuable asset to me. This time.,
"Got something to say about me, sweetheart? Heh.",
"Well, well. What a powerful group of people. Such a team - are you guys looking for a fight?",
...We're just visiting Freyja.,
"Hmph... Did you bring me a gift? Even though this is the Dreamland, this territory still belongs to us Dragons.",
"Um... I can give you Loki? Look at her, she'd make a very pretty decoration.",
"Not interested. If you want to pass through my territory, I expect a proper gift.",
"Lady Ember, do you mean... you want to challenge Asgard's Queen?",
"Little Thor, I watched you grow up. You may not know this, but even Odin must abide by the rules of the Dragon Clan.",
"But I'm not Odin, honey.",
"Clearly. Fine, let me see if your fighting skills have improved in the past thousand years! Or if I need to get out the diapers for you. Haha!",
What a good fight! I will consider that your gift.,
"Don't be silly. I will have two statues built in your honor. One to stand in the Asgardens, and one for your territory.",
"You don't have to do so much for me, my Queen. I wish you luck in your chat with Freyja.",
"Frigga, you've arrived.",
Odin? Why are you here?,
Freyja asked me to persuade you to go back. So I've got to at least look like I tried to.,
"I don't really feel like fighting you, but...",
"Do it, otherwise you can't see Freyja today.",
You are much stronger than before.,
"I almost lost control of myself, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.",
I am proud to see how much you've grown. No one would have believed you'd take the initiative to reconcile with Freyja.,
"Even immortal gods can change. At least, I have.",
"Remember to tell Freyja you kicked my butt, hehe. Otherwise I'll get in trouble.",
"After everything, you still came. My sister, Frigga.",
"I have come to reconcile with you, sister. I did many cruel things to you, for the sake of being Queen.",
It is not me you need to reconcile with. It is yourself.,
"In the fight for the throne, I did not face you like a true Asgardian warrior...",
"Instead, I used subterfuge and trickery to win.",
"That is true, but I have forgiven you. Allowing such feelings to fester in your heart will only cause you pain. But if you really can't let go...",
"Then perhaps a duel may help to appease the guilt in your heart. Come sister, let us face each other as true Asgardian warriors.",
You are right. Let's do it.,
"See, even in a fair fight, you have the power to defeat me now. That is why I have no objections to you being Queen.",
But...,
I see that you still cannot forgive yourself and will be tormented by your own guilt.,
"Tell me, are you willing to let go of your former self and accept my forgiveness?",
"I understand, sister. I will chase away the shadows in my heart.",
"Then face your past self, and take back your willpower!",
I need time to figure this all out...,
Then I will watch over you until the day when you are ready to face your past.,
"Hehe, you returned to me, my other half.",
"We haven't tasted blood in so long... You must miss it, right? Is our blood-soaked rose garden still alive?",
I no longer grow roses. That land has now become a paradise for the gods of Asgard.,
"Tsk. I don't understand you. You stopped at nothing to become Queen, but now you are willing to throw it away so easily.",
"I will no longer rely on those methods. Even if I gain power through such disgraceful deeds, power alone will not convince the gods.",
I must regain my honor and dignity in the eyes of the gods. Even if it costs me the throne!,
Can you really do it? Go ahead and try...,
I didn't think that you would actually defeat me...,
"I will say goodbye to you, to my old self.",
"You have grown a lot... But I am your shadow, I will not disappear so easily...",
"As long as you still have regrets, guilt, and cowardice in your heart... As long as you still can't let go of the past... Sooner or later, I will return.",
"I will remember my past mistakes, but I will no longer let them hold me back.",
We shall see...,

"Oh my, look who we have here.",
The famous Goddess of Wisdom and War! The mighty Athena!,
Stop with such flattery. I am in trouble and need your help.,
Wait... Your divine power... It's gone! What has happened?,
Poseidon started a war! She caused an earthquake that sank Athens into the sea. She's trying to turn it into the new Atlantis!,
So you gave all of your divinity to save the city? How compassionate of you.,
Cut the sarcastic comments. Just give me your magic box so I can use it to fight Poseidon.,
Unfortunately my magic box doesn't work that way. But I do have a way to help you regain your powers.,
Great! What do I have to do?,
"First of all, you have to pass my trial... But since you're mortal now, can you do it?",
Heh... You better not underestimate the power of mortals!,
"You lost, Pandora. Victory belongs to me, the Goddess of War!",
"It seems that even without your divinity, you are not one to be underestimated in battle.",
"Yes, now tell me your plan.",
"Well, it's a bit difficult to explain. Before that, let's go meet some old friends of yours.",
"Pandora, I don't remember inviting you here.",
"It doesn't matter if you don't want to see me. But, this goddess here wants to see you.",
Athena? I have nothing to say to goddesses like you. Wait... you don't have a divine aura?,
Oh let me guess! You're mortal? Hehe I didn't expect to enjoy to have a treat like you today.,
"I think you'll find she's no mere treat. Instead, you'll taste defeat today.",
And how do you propose to do that? Do you think you're still the high and mighty Goddess of War? You're a mortal now!,
"Yes, I'm mortal. But don't you know? Even mortals can defeat gods.",
I didn't expect you to defeat me so easily without your divinity.,
Hmm it's strange but I think I feel the beginnings of my power returning.,
Hehe. Then my plan is working. Every opponent you defeat in this dreamland will help you regain a part of your divinity.,
"How exciting. So, when I defeat my last opponent...?",
Your divinity will be fully restored.,
"This method seems right up my alley, I will enjoy it. As for you... Care to join me and witness it?",
"Oh yes, I would like to see how a mortal can regain lost divinity.",
Here's your next opponent. But I guess you're more familiar with her than I am.,
"Even when I was a goddess, she was rather difficult to deal with.",
"Don't forget, mortals have beaten her once before. With aid from none other than yourself.",
"Long time no see, Medusa.",
"Athena? How dare you show your face in my temple? Hold on, your divinity is gone.",
"I protected the city of Athens against Poseidon's attack, using my divine power.",
What a selfless act. Or perhaps it's stupidity.,
"And you actually came to meet me, your former enemy, in your mortal state. I admire your courage.",
You pose no threat to me. I already know all your weaknesses.,
Hehe well I'd love to have a statue of a goddess to decorate my temple.,
"Throw in the towel, Medusa. The Goddess of War doesn't need to rely on luck to win.",
"Aw, how unlucky for me! What do you want with me?",
"Don't worry, my dear. I just used this battle with you to regain part of my lost divinity.",
"Heh... The last mortal who defeated me removed my head. Speaking of, where are you going?",
"Where else? To regain the rest of my power, of course. And then to settle things with Poseidon.",
"If you're going after Poseidon, count me in! She flooded my temple.",
I never thought that one day we would be on the same side.,
Don't get carried away. This is only a temporary truce. Let's go.,
"Pandora, why have you brought me to the underworld? You know mortals cannot easily escape once stepping foot in here.",
"Calm down, we're only going as far as the nightmare controlled by Phantasos. We don't need to cross the river Styx.",
"I knew I sensed someone's aura approaching. You are neither dead nor asleep, what are you doing here?",
"Phantasos, I need a crystal formed from the essence of your dream.",
"Hmm... If I did give it to you, what are you planning to do with it?",
"We need to synthesize it into a replacement vessel for divinity, and then provide divine power to Athena.",
Oh? The once incomparable Goddess of Wisdom and War has actually lost her divinity?,
"But I am not a philanthropist. If you want it, you will have to take it.",
"Then in the name of the Goddess of Wisdom and War, prepare yourself!",
I do not understand. How are you able to shatter my nightmare as a mortal?,
"Strength may be the door to victory, but wisdom is the key. You failed to see that because of your arrogance.",
"Well whatever, the fact is I lost to you. I will give you a dream crystal.",
"In addition, let me go with you to see how your so-called wisdom is reflected on the battlefield.",
"I have no objection, Goddess of Nightmares.",
"Next, let's go to the Zodiac, to collect the light of the stars and awaken the energy of the dream crystal.",
"This is the forbidden area of the Zodiac. Goddesses of Olympus, this place is not for you.",
"It's okay, we just need a little starlight from the Zodiac.",
"I remember you, Athena...",
"I also remember you, Goddess Pan. It was I who used trickery to turn you into what you are now.",
"...I am not angry, nor do I want revenge, but the righteousness in my heart drives me to seek justice from you.",
"I accept your justice. Come, it's an honor to end it with a fight.",
"Although your justice did not prevail, I admire your unyielding will.",
"Victory doesn't favor me today. Well, you can take anything from the Zodiac as your prize.",
"Don't worry, all I need is a little bit of starlight.",
"Athena, are you trying to recover your lost divinity? Perhaps I can help you on your journey?",
Are you really willing to help me? Even though I have hurt you in the past.,
"The truth is, changing from the Goddess Pan to Capricornus was not too difficult to accept.",
Athena? Why have you come to the dreams of the Zodiac?,
It's been a while. I need a bit of help.,
You... don't seem to have your divinity anymore?,
It's all thanks to Poseidon.,
I've heard of your war with Poseidon. So you want to use the portal here to go straight to Poseidon's palace?,
That's right.,
You won't be able to stay in the ocean for long with your mortal body. I can give you the power to breathe underwater.,
"But due to my status as the guardian of the portal, I can't just give you this ability...",
I understand. I'll go easy on you.,
Stop! I really didn't expect you to still be so powerful after losing your divinity.,
"Thank you, my dear.",
"Of course, I'm just doing the great Goddess of Wisdom and War a small favor.",
"I am the Guardian of the Sea and the Celestial Gate, who are you? What do you want in the underwater world?",
Is this phantom that looks like me... the guardian of the dream passage?,
The dream under the sea does not allow for an existence such as you to enter.,
"Unfortunately, I also don't want an existence like you to stand in my way!",
What a powerful display! It's been a long time since I saw such exquisite fighting skills.,
"Looks like I've regained most of my divine power. Let's move on, I want to get back to the waking world as soon as possible.",
Poseidon! I am standing in front of your palace right now. Come out and face me! Or do you want me to tear down your throne first?,
"Athena, I admire you for daring to confront me in the dreamland, even without your divinity.",
"Poseidon, I cannot forgive you for flooding Athens. As the Goddess of War, you will face my judgement!",
"I thought you could understand my current situation after losing your divinity, but it seems that I was hoping for too much.",
"No, I understand that it was painful for you to lose your original divinity when you descended into the mortal world.",
But that's no reason to flood the whole world!,
Then there is nothing more to be said. We can only fight!,
"It's over, Poseidon! Let the seas recede, and I will let this matter go.",
"No, this is the only way I can regain my divine power and strength. I can't just give up like this.",
"Very well, I will give you a second chance if you dare.",
"Athena, I will step in for Poseidon in the next battle.",
Zeus! Why?,
"Poseidon is my sister, and you should treat her with the respect she deserves.",
"I'd be happy to do so if she hadn't tried to harm my people, but now...",
Then let me fight you instead of her.,
...That's not what I expected.,
"You can't hide it from me. As the Goddess of War, you've been longing for the day when you get to face me in battle, right?",
"Hehe. You seem to be hesitant, Lady Athena. Do you need me to give you some confidence?",
No. I will face this battle in the body of a mortal.,
"It is my victory! Even without my original divinity, I still defeated the Ruler of Olympus.",
"Yes, Athena, you are victorious. Your kindness and wisdom are worthy of your rediscovered power.",
"Perhaps we should all reflect on whether we, as gods, have fallen into eternal arrogance.",
"Don't talk so grandly, Athena, or did you forget what you did to the people of Troy during the Trojan War?",
Apollo?!,
"You may be merciful, but isn't it only to your own people? Haven't you vented your anger against the people of other countries?",
"...I'm sorry, Apollo. I've always tried to be fair in wars, but you had left me with no other choice.",
"Fight me with your current power. If you win, then I will recognize your will!",
Then draw your weapon!,
"Very well, I admire your courage and willingness to face responsibility.",
Let us take off our armor and settle our grievances like two mortals!,
"I have no intention of fighting you, it's pointless!",
"Hmph! As I thought, the Goddess of Wisdom is not impulsive.",
"Then let's decide the outcome on a future battlefield. You lead the Athenian army, and I will lead the Macedonian warriors!",
"I accept your challenge, this mortal battle. If I win, I hope you can let go of the grievances of the past.",
No problem... if you win. Let's get started!,
"Heh you really are skilled, Goddess of Wisdom and War. If it were the former you, it would have been my victory. But now...",
"In fact, I also let you show me your moves. If I went all out, the fight would have been over too soon.",
"Hmph! Even if you say that, you did win, so we no longer have any grudges against each other.",
But I hope that in the future you will be fair and just not only for your own people but also everyone else.,
I will never let anyone down again.,

"Of the two most charming goddesses of the Nordic region, who would you favor more, Freyja or me?",
Nordic gods often say love involves blind sacrifices. Is that so?,

I enjoy watching things wilt. The end result reminds me of roses smashed by a hammer. Beauty can be found even in its own destruction.,

"Really? Is that the truth, or are you lying?",
"Hmm, you seem to hesitate. Would you rather become fertilizer in my rose garden.",
,
"So, what would you sacrifice for me?",
,
Interesting! Shall we test it?,
"As a child, she enjoyed playing with me. I taught her a lot about wielding a hammer.",
"Hmph, after witnessing me pulverizing monsters on the battlefield, I believe you would understand.",
"As a child, she enjoyed playing with me. I taught her a lot about wielding a hammer.",

"Pandora, come out! I know you are hiding in the Dreamland. I need your power to create a new world order.",
"Who is yelling so rudely? Huh, Asura?",
"You bloodthirsty goddesses who live and thrive on the battlefield, you want to reshape the world?",
"This is not a joke. I've been watching the real world, watching you so-called goddesses.",
Interesting. So what have you seen?,
"Hmph, a world where gods and humans are supposedly equals, a world tainted by morality.",
It is time to shatter this illusion. I will bring new change. I will create a world where the strong are respected.,
"Hehe, I like your idea. But I'm curious, how will you set about doing this?",
"I will topple the current pantheons. Then I will have the goddesses fight for their status and power, under the new rules I set.",
"That doesn't sound bad. But before you let me help you, why don't you prove your strength to me?",
"I, Asura of Purgatory, always welcome a challenge.",
"So, how does it feel to be stepped on?",
"You are truly unrivaled. But since you are already so powerful, what can I do to help?",
"Your ability will allow me to spread my will to every inch of the land, which is much more efficient than defeating each god one by one.",
This really suits your style...,
This is the Dreamland of the Egyptian goddesses...?,
That's right. The goddesses of Egypt control the balance between life and death. So I want to challenge them for it.,
"Is this Purgatory's Goddess of War, Asura? It's a real surprise to see you here. Why did you and Pandora come to this dreamland?",
"I'm here for one thing, and one thing only. To challenge you, and claim power over life and death.",
"What do you want the power of life and death for? With your current strength, you should already be able to dominate your enemies.",
"This is far from enough... Sun Goddess, I watched the world from Purgatory, and there is chaos everywhere. The strong sacrifice their lives while the weak survive.",
It goes against the natural order of things for the strong to sacrifice themselves for the weak.,
"On the contrary, the strong protect the weak, so they have the opportunity to grow strong. This way, humans and goddesses can survive together.",
It seems that your long reign has blinded your eyes. I am afraid that your kindness will be the downfall of us all.,
"All I see is that the givers get nothing, while the lazy ones sit back and enjoy everything that is handed to them.",
"Well, if you insist on thinking so... Nephthys, give her the power of life.",
Um... Are you sure that she won't fall during the battle of the inheritance ritual?,
"Her ideals drive her to face these trials. If she falls in battle, then it is simply fate.",
"Enough talking, let's get to it.",
The ritual is over. The power of life is now under my control.,
"Well, even if we are in a dream, this proves your strength.",
Show me the power of death already.,
"Death is a good tool, to weed out those who are not strong enough.",
"Although we have the power of death, we have never used it as a tool. We only use it in accordance with the rules of nature.",
"I don't quite agree with that, Sun Goddess. I will use my own strength to prove the true value of death as a tool.",
Then see if you can master death.,
"Anubis, come. It is time for the ritual.",
"Understood, I will follow the command of the Sun Goddess.",
The ritual is over. Now the power of death is in my hands!,
"Allow Nephthys and Anubis to follow you. Maybe when you truly understand the power of life and death, you will need their help.",
"I don't need helpers... But I won't object to them following me. After all, it is instinct to follow the strong.",
You will eventually understand the reason for this arrangement.,
"I heard that the one who controls the power of order and chaos is in your homeland, Pandora?",
"The power of order and chaos are in the hands of two goddesses, Athena and Hades. While Zeus, the King of the Greek Pantheon, possesses both.",
It seems that my target is this King. I will have a good chat with her.,
Who has trespassed into the dreamland of the Greek Pantheon?,
"Zeus? I thought that a high and mighty ruler, such as yourself, would be sitting comfortably on your throne deep in this dreamland.",
"Foreign goddess, may I take what you just said as a challenge?",
"I have heard of your deeds, foreign goddess. You call yourself Asura, proclaiming the end of this world and the birth of a new one with cruel laws.",
"But since you have named yourself a goddess, you did not come from chaos, but from order. Only order can give birth to consciousness.",
That's right. But don't you think it's perfect for those born of order to break order. Do you not have the courage to do so?,
"I adhere to order, because I have control over myself. And it allows me, and all my people, to live in peace.",
"Peace is not equivalent to order, my dear. I will prove it to you.",
"Powerful though you are, Goddess of Wisdom, your creed of order will also crumble to dust in my hands.",
"Does violence alone explain the meaning of order? It's rather simple, but the outcome of this battle validates your idea of order.",
"Don't get complacent, foreign goddess. You have only defeated the representative of order. I am looking forward to seeing how you will fare against the power of chaos.",
The raging waves of the underworld will wash away all self-righteous and arrogant ones!,
"For a moment, I felt that you and I were very similar... But coming face to face with you, I realize our essential difference.",
"You want to build a world where the strong rule. So in your eyes, are plots and schemes the work of the strong?",
"What a boring question. Plots are worthless in my opinion. Without the fury of the battlefield, one is not worthy to master the power of chaos.",
"Well then, this battle will prove it.",
The power of the underworld is indeed strong. But it is also so chaotic that it tries to swallow everything. It needs to be guided.,
"I'm glad that you and I agree on this point, at least.",
"Now all that's left is to defeat me. Then you can inherit the power of order and chaos, and redefine the world as you wish.",
"All it takes is to defeat you? Honestly, you are much more straightforward than I imagined...",
"Don't get me wrong, honey. This won't be a piece of cake.",
"I know, I already saw the lightning behind you. This is the duel I want!",
"It seems that I am more powerful than you, King of the Greek Pantheon.",
"Strength is necessary to control order and chaos, but you also need wisdom to balance it.",
"Take Athena and Hades with you. When the moment comes that you hold the world in your grasp, you will need them to balance things.",
"Halt! This is the Realm of the Norse Goddesses, and anyone from other Divine Realms is not welcome.",
"The Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall... She is known for her sense and loyalty.",
I'm not here to quarrel with her. I just need to cross the bridge and send a messenger to inform everyone.,
"Back off, or I'm going to have to be rude.",
Yeah? Hehe... I'd love to see just how rude the Guardian of Asgard can be.,
"Wait... You're not a Greek Goddess. If not for the war, why do you want to break into the Nordic Sanctuary?",
Don't be nervous. I just have a little something to discuss with Odin.,
"It's not exactly easy to meet Odin, especially if you have not been invited.",
"That's okay, she'll be more than happy to give me the invitation in person when I'm standing in front of her.",
No one has ever faced a Norse goddess without batting an eye. You have extraordinary courage and fighting spirit.,
"Tell me your name and purpose, foreign goddess!",
"I am Asura the Peerless, Purgatory's God of War from Mount Sumeru, and I am here to obtain the wisdom of Odin!",
Not a small ambition... but I'm afraid you have to pass me first!,
Exactly what I want!,
Hmph you have good fighting skills. I thought you were just talk.,
"Hehe I'm not the slightest bit interested in bluffing, but you... You are quite interesting to me.",
It's been a long time since I've had to take a fight that seriously.,
"Tell me, what do you want Odin's wisdom for?",
"It's simple. To get stronger, strong enough to change the old rules of the past.",
"You're an interesting one. I'll keep an eye on you, to see your next move.",
"Asura, I predicted your arrival.",
"The appearance of a goddess like you is inevitable. With a history as long as ours, such things are bound to happen.",
Your words have really surprised me.,
"Not only did I know the time of your arrival, I also your reason for being here...",
All things must be born and die. Order and chaos...it is impossible to avoid such things.,
Hmph... I am starting to understand what Zeus and Athena mean by wisdom.,
"Since you have such wisdom, you should already know what the result of our battle with be, right?",
Have you heard of the Way of Harmony? The mystical teachings of the sages of your country.,
An outsider like you knows about the Way of Harmony?,
Maybe more than you can imagine.,
"Too bad I'm not interested. I was never educated by the sages of Mount Sumeru, so why would I listen to you?",
I don't want to teach you anything - aren't you trying to establish a world where the strong are respected? How about a game?,
How do you feel after our fight? Do you think you beat me? Can you feel the joy of battle?,
"I did beat you... but I don't feel joy. It's weird, it's more like emptiness.",
"You believe that the strong should be respected, but the strong and the weak are inseparable in this world.",
"There will always be people who are weak, but many of them will become strong, just like you in this Dreamland.",
"So, what are your thoughts now, about The Strong?",
No one is born strong. Strength is forged from the weak.,
Sensible answer. I think it's time for you to find a breakthrough on your own.,
You will face the most powerful of the Dragon Clan. Try to experience things from the perspective of the weak.,
"Who has trespassed into my territory? Foreign goddess, you are seeking a fight, am I right?",
"As you said, dragon. If I want to know what it means to be truly strong, I must face you as the weak.",
Arrogant goddess... But I see you have courage and wisdom too. Let's enjoy this fight.,
As you wish!,
"Well, your victory does not surprise me. After all, you have gone through many trials in this Dreamland.",
"I can feel new power flowing through my body. It's a completely different experience, to go from weak to strong.",
"I think I understand now what true strength is, as well as the meaning and value those who are weak.",
You understand things now. This resolve will accompany you as you set foot into a higher realm.,
The division between strength and weakness is absolute. There is no so-called growth.,
"Well then, continue along your path. Maybe this is the only way for you to become stronger.",

Radiant Starsoul,
Capricornus? What a surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?,
I... don't know. I was dreaming - the same dream over and over again.,
A repeated dream?,
"Yes, I think... I was dreaming about my past. But when I woke up, I couldn't remember anything.",
Your past? Heh... that's a dangerous thing.,
What happened back then? I need to make sense of it all.,
"It's better that you don't know. Although, I think the troubles from your past won't let you remain blissfully ignorant.",
"Well I can help you, if you wish. But only if you pass my trial.",
Do you mean defeating you in battle? I'll give it a try.,
You have passed my test... barely. You don't seem to excel at single combat?,
...My skills are mostly used to strengthen and protect my precious friends.,
Hmm... I have a plan then. Take me to meet your friends. You will need powerful allies.,
That makes sense. Let me think about who I should go to...,
"Pisces, are you there? Here fishie fishie.",
Capricornus? It's been a long time! Have you been well? Wait... Pandora? What are you doing in my dream?,
"You don't look happy to see me. Your friend here wants to find out about her past, and I'm just here to help fulfil her wish.",
"Her past? Capricornus, are you sure you really want to do this?",
If I say that it's what my heart really desires... Will you help me?,
"I don't know what the knowledge of your past will do to you now, but you're my friend and I shall abide by your wishes.",
"Although you must defeat me first, to break the shackles by which I am bound to my oath to the Lord God. I swore not to interfere in this matter...",
"Well, if I have to do this...",
Victory is mine. Please help me get back my lost memories.,
"As you wish, I will help you find your memories, even if it is... dangerous.",
"If you want to reach your heart's desire, one companion is not enough. We will need more. Who's next?",
"Sigh... Gemini. To be honest, I don't really want to see them...",
"Honey, I see you have arrived with Pandora. Let me guess, she's promised to give you your heart's desire.",
You guessed it. I want to find out about my past.,
"All I can say, is that it wasn't a beautiful past. Why are you trying to remember?",
"I want to know exactly what the hell happened back then, that's made you all so scared.",
I think it's better for you not to know. You will not like who you used to be.,
I...,
Hmph. I can see from the look on your face that you're thinking about giving up.,
"I don't know... With what everyone has said, I'm starting to question whether it's really worth it or not.",
It is up to you to decide your own destiny. But I will respect your choice.,
...I still need to know what happened.,
Then show me your resolve.,
Hmm. You're starting to look more and more like your former self when you fight.,
"Since you are so determined to get your memory back, I agree to your request.",
"Thank you, sister.",
"Phantasos is the master of memory, so if we can find her, we will have a better chance of being able to help you find your lost memories.",
Let's go find her then.,
"Pandora, it's you again. As a fellow ruler of the dream world, I really didn't want to see a wretch like you.",
"As for you... Guardians of the Zodiac, what are you doing in the Dreamland?",
"I want to know about my past, can you help me?",
Capricornus? Heh... Maybe it would more appropriate call you the goddess Pan.,
Pan?,
"Pan, the Goddess of Fear. The one who even I, the Goddess of Nightmares, feared when you walked through my dreams.",
The mere whisper of your name was enough to terrify any who heard it.,
...I can see the fear in your eyes. What irony!,
Your words... Are they really true?,
"You can feel the truth of my words. Even now, you can feel the instinct to cause fear. I can tell.",
...,
"Didn't you want to know about your past? If you can defeat me, I will give your memories back to you.",
"Stop, stop. You really show no mercy on the battlefield...",
"Oh darling, showing mercy would only have caused you more suffering.",
"This dream crystal has your memories stored within. But unfortunately, it is sealed by the power of a certain goddess.",
What is this? What's going on?,
"I don't know. But judging by the seal on this lock, it was mostly likely made by Zeus.",
"Well, I knew it was going to be like this.",
"Let's go find her. And just in case, why don't you come with us?",
"I don't want to get involved in your affairs, you have already retrieved your memories. What you do next has nothing to do with me.",
Is that so? If we told Zeus that it was you who gave us the memories that were meant to be kept safe...,
What do you think Zeus would do to you?,
You...! Sigh. It's never a good thing to be involved with you. I'll help you one last time.,
"Isn't that Icarus? How did she come to serve as a gatekeeper for Mount Olympus, home of the Greek Goddesses?",
"Capricornus? Goddesses of the Zodiac, why have you come to this Dreamland?",
"I've come to see Zeus, I need her to unseal my memories.",
"Unfortunately, I have an appointment with Zeus today. I'm afraid you will have to tcome another day.",
"However, I also have things that I have to do. If I miss today, it will be difficult to find another chance in the future.",
"Interesting, it seems that fate wants us to take a gamble. How about a battle to determine the order?",
"I didn't expect that I would be the one to lose... Well, I have my word. You may see Zeus first.",
I was wondering... Would you like to join us and we meet Zeus together?,
...It seems you have a kind heart now. You were not like this hundreds of years ago.,
"And just like that, I now realize what kind of person I was.",
"Truth and curiousity are always our biggest problems. Alas, this too is fate.",
"It seems that my prophecy has come true, and the Goddess of Fear has finally embarked on the path of destruction.",
I told Zeus that avoiding this problem wouldn't work. Denying your fear will not make it go away.,
"The Sun Goddess, Apollo? Why are you here?",
Because I knew you would come.,
Are you here to stop me then?,
"My duty as a goddess compells me to protect Olympus, but the light in my heart makes me yearn for truth.",
"Come, let us seek answers in battle.",
"It seems that none of us can stop the arrival of our predetermined destiny. I hope that when you face your past self, you can do so without regret or fear.",
I will.,
"I was arguing with Zeus about you not too long ago, Capricornus.",
Do you also believe that I shouldn't seek to recover my past memories?,
"Firstly, I will say that I do not deny the significance of your existence, but... Zeus is right about one thing. Your existence will bring disaster to the world.",
Disaster? What do you mean?,
Fear is a powerful thing. It is capable of destroying a person's mind faster than it would take to destroy their body. It can effortlessly devastate entire armies.,
"If such a power is allowed to spread unchecked, the entire world will eventually be engulfed in chaos.",
"And you, who were once known as Pan... You are the embodiment of fear and chaos.",
"Goddess of Wisdom, if there is no fear then both humans and goddesses will lose the will to live and respect for all things.",
"Capricornus. The truth about your past, or stability amongst the gods. Which one will you choose?",
"The power I once had may have been terrifying, but I will never allow it to get out of control again.",
Then you have forced my hand.,
"The divine presence that you once commanded, capable of inducing fear, is gradually awakening... Is this the beginning of another disaster?",
"Just like before when you, driven by your own ambition, rampantly spread fear among the gods, until Zeus completely sealed your memories and divinity.",
"No, I'm not here out of ambition. I just want to know who I am.",
I hope that history will not repeat itself.,
"By Zeus' command, you shall not pass.",
Ruler of the Underworld... Hades?!,
"The fear you once unleashed shattered the balance between life and death, almost plunging the order between the world of the living and the realm of the dead into chaos.",
"I understand your concerns, but I have no intention of giving up the right to regain my own memories.",
How about we see if you have the ability to actually do it?,
Just as before... You are still the same nightmare that haunts the dreams of your enemies.,
"However, my power no longer relies on fear. It comes from sacrifice, doesn't it?",
"Hah well if you still insist on retrieving your memories and power, then perhaps it is also a kind of fate.",
"I will remember your words, Hades.",
The Temple of Zeus is just ahead. It looks like she's already waiting for us over there.,
"Pandora, are my memories good to go?",
"Of course, once Zeus unseals it, the Dream Crystal can be opened.",
"Alright, then let's go in and face her.",
"Don't bother, Capricornus. No, I should call you... Pan.",
"I'm here in the hope that you will unlock the seal of my memory, and let me regain my true self.",
"However, that won't be possible.",
"Could it be that it's as Athena said... Are you just afraid that, like in the past, my ambition will pose a threat to you?",
"I am not obligated to answer you, unless...",
"Unless I prove to you that I can control my gradually increasing power, right?",
"Now that we've come to this, I don't think anymore words are necessary.",
I never imagined I could defeat you...,
"I could have completely destroyed you when I sealed your power, but I didn't want to do that.",
"I respect all the beings of Olympus, even if they are my enemies, or enemies of Olympus.",
So why do you keep hindering my search for my own memories?,
"Perhaps it is indeed unfair to deprive you of your memories, since you really want to see who you were...",
"But you will definitely regret it, and beg me to seal away your memories again.",
...,
"The power you once possessed came entirely from fear. With such power, losing control is the only possible outcome.",
To release your memories again is nothing more than bringing forth tragedy once again.,
"Unlike in the past, the power you have now comes from devotion and sacrifice, which is just as strong. Isn't this what you want?",
That's right. That's why I have the confidence to face my horrible past self.,
...It seems like I can no longer dissuade you.,
I will unlock the seal on your memories and let you face the horror that is your past self. May Fate protect us all.,
"I saw it... My power and my past, all my memories are being restored!",
What on earth is this?! Is this the old me?,
...,
Pull yourself together and face it! You are no longer the same out-of-control person that stands before you. Summon the courage to confront this!,
It was only for a little bit but... That feeling was so nostalgic and yet terrifying. But it's over now.,
Looks like fate is on our side.,
I never thought that my former self could be so crazy and powerful. Just looking at her is enough to make anyone tremble with fear.,
"But now you have countless companions around you, don't you?",
"Should you be controlled once more by the soul within your memory, the world will once again witness the coming of the apocalypse.",
"But perhaps this is also fate. Without facing one's own past darkness, one cannot seek a new rebirth.",
"I understand... Pandora, hand that memory crystal to me. I will bury it in a place where no one can find it.",
"The Goddess of Fear will be forgotten. From now on, the world will only know Capricornus.",
You're right. I should cherish the present more.,
"Not allowing you to retrieve your true memories may seem unfair to you, but trust me, this is the best choice.",
No need to apologize to me. Maybe this is also fate. Let's leave the Dreamland.,

Apocalypse Avatar,
Carefree Enchantment - Zeus,
"Absolutely no! You are God's chosen one, and you must fulfill the task God has given you.",
"Pandora, my favorite attendant! Come and greet your master.",
Ugh Zeus... you again. I assume you haven't been invading my dreams again and again just for a simple chat?,
"Of course not. But if you want me to play with you, I'd be happy to oblige.",
Sigh. You still love the sound of your own voice... saying such ridiculous things. Cut to the chase already.,
"Prometheus came to me in my dreams, and she told me that the Titans were waking up.",
"They want to use the souls of the Gods as a link, absorb our power to help them reshape their bodies, and then return to this world.",
That sounds rather serious. So what are you going to do?,
"Until now, only I have been able to keep them sealed away... However, I have discovered that your magic box can also imprison them.",
So you plan to put their souls in my Box to solve this problem once and for all?,
"Yes, but I think it will be hard to do on my own... I need you to get me in touch with my old friends from Egypt and Asgard.",
Well I guess I can help you for old times' sake. But not for free and not until you pass my test.,
"How tiresome... Doesn't the Ruler of Olympus merit special privileges with you, my kitten?",
Privileges? I know what your idea of privileges is... Heh alright. I'll be gentle with your body... when I beat you up!,
"Eh? Why did you fall down so easily? My dear, I thought you would be a little rougher.",
I really don't want to be toyed with by you... Oh well. But you best be prepared to pay the bill for this request.,
"Darling, when this is over, I'll give you half of Olympus.",
Yeah yeah. That silver tongue of yours may have fooled many others. But did you truly think your words will seduce me?,
Take a guess. Now connect me to the dream of the Egyptian Goddesses. It's time for me to meet that rigid Sun Goddess.,
"Guardian of the Pyramids. Horus, the Eye of Truth. Have you been well?",
"Greek Goddess Zeus. What brings you here? Perhaps you came to find the Lady Sun Goddess... to reminisce about the old days, of course.",
It seems that nothing can escape your eye. My real reason for coming here to borrow the power of the Sun Goddess.,
"My apologies, but Lady Sun Goddess predicted your arrival and sent me to refuse your request.",
It breaks my heart to hear that. And what if I insist on seeing her?,
"Then I'm afraid you will have to go through me. If you beat me, I will take you to her.",
"Not bad. Although the outcome of the battle was as expected, your divine power has grown a lot since the last time I came here.",
Hmph...,
Don't be so angry. Pouting doesn't suit you. Please lead the way.,
"Ra, has it been thousands of years since we last met? I miss the good times of drinking ale with you, dear.",
Zeus? For goodness sake! You being here means nothing good will happen.,
Don't say that. I think you're going crazy... Even in the dream your figure is so graceful.,
"Isn't it time to wake up from your daydream? Now tell me, what troubles have you brought?",
"I love that you get straight to the point like that, avoids wasting time. I'll be honest... It's bad news. The Titans are back.",
"...They're the ancestors of the Greek Goddesses that you sealed away, right?",
"As you said... But I need your help, because I can't real them alone this time.",
Your divine power seems to have weakened... This is not good. Let me test how much power you still have left!,
It seems that you only have half the power you used to have. So tthe most important thing right now is to recover the power you lost.,
"Heh... After all, I did come to Pandora's Dreamland to ask for help in order to gain more power.",
"Well now, how rare for you to be so responsible... I will agree to help you solve this trouble, reluctantly. What's your next step?",
You'll find out after we visit Odin.,
I feel the power of thunder. Who is controlling this storm?,
"Ruler of Olympus, turn back! Asgard is closed to outsiders right now.",
"It's the Norse Goddess Thor. What has happened? Asgard doesn't look peaceful, even here in the Dreamland.",
Loki started a rebellion. She nearly destroyed Asgard. How do I know you're not on her side?,
"Take it easy, honey. Where is Odin? How about I get rid of Loki for you and you let me meet Odin?",
"Sorry, but I can't risk it. If you insist on breaking in, then I will have to make you suffer.",
"How interesting. I don't hate tough girls at all, hehe...",
"...As expected of the strongest Goddess in Olympus, your lightning is no joke.",
"Compared to Odin's strength, you're not bad. I'm really starting to like you.",
"Since you won, perhaps you do have what it takes to help us deal with the troublesome Loki.",
"Let's talk after we meet Odin, dear.",
Ah... isn't this Zeus? I don't remember inviting you to this banquet.,
"I'm not interested in your banquet, Goddess of Lies. I just want to catch up with Odin.",
"Unfortunately, your old friend is not available at the moment, since I have an appointment with her.",
Odin! I know you're here! Why don't you come out and meet your old friends?,
"Huh...Zeus? And the Sun Goddess of Egypt, Ra. You two have come at a bad time...",
"As you can see, I'm about to teach this troublemaker a lesson.",
You've lost your touch. Has it been so long since you encountered someone strong enough to arouse... your fighting spirit?,
"Dance with me in battle, darling. I will remind you how real power feels.",
...,
Oh? What an exciting way to greet each other.,
"Your power is much more than before, isn't it?",
"It would be more accurate to say that in the Dreamland, I can display my true power..",
,
Oh dear... Ganging up to bully lil ol' me?,
"Save it. Even if I fight alone, I wouldn't lose to you.",
"Hmph. Before you fight me, I suggest you ask Zeus why she came here. After all, she doesn't seem to be here just to catch up.",
"She's right, Odin. The Titans are awakening, and I can't handle this on my own.",
Hmm so Loki just happens to stir up trouble at the same time? What a coincidence.,
"Haha! You guessed it, Odin! The Twelve Titans send their regards.",
Ugh you're stronger than I expected. But defeating me means nothing! I've delayed you enough.,
You sly fox. I'll deal with you after we handle this problem.,
"Hehe... Ruler of Olympus... If you survive the Titans, I look forward to some exciting fun with you. See you soon!",
"What a slippery bastard. What now, Zeus? Do you want to make a battle plan?",
,
...,
"Apollo, has Olympus been attacked by the Titans? ...Wait, you're not Apollo!",
"What a keen intuition. Guess who I am, third-generation King of Olympus, Zeus.",
This magic is... Titan Hyperion? That's impossible...,
I am honored that you still remember me after all these years.,
How on Earth did you come back? And where did you get Apollo's soul?,
It took a lot of effort to get Loki of the Norse Goddesses to help us escape from the seal. As for Apollo...,
I'm just borrowing her body for a while. She is still alive inside here.,
Interesting. I swear that this time I'll let you rot in the seal until the end of time.,
Are you done? I have tens of thousands of years of anger that I want to vent on you.,
I... What's wrong with me? It's as if someone had taken control of my mind...,
"A Titan occupied your body. After we defeated her, her soul was scattered in the Dream. You are fine now.",
"Phew... Turns out even I, the most cautious goddess in Olympus, can be careless sometimes...",
This crisis has been partly resolved. I need to deal with the other Titans as soon as possible.,
I feel like I'm still not strong enough...,
"Have you finally figured it out? You alone cannot defeat us in this Dream, Zeus.",
"Hades? No...Crius of the Twelve Titans, the soul in Hades' body is you, right?",
"You have a good memory, Zeus. I thought you'd have forgotten my name after sealing us away for so long.",
"I don't mind throwing you back into the Abyss to seal you again, so prepare yourself.",
Do you dare to attack me while I'm in Hades' body?!,
"Do you think I didn't consider that? Did you forget, we're in Pandora's Dreamland right now...",
...I am perfectly capable of ripping your soul to pieces without harming Hades' body.,
The arrogance... I dare you to try.,
"You may have defeated me today, but I will be back! Remember that, Zeus!",
"...She's finally gone from my head. If you had taken any longer, I would have been completely lost.",
"Hades, how did you end up being controlled by a Titan?",
"I can only say that the Titans are growing stronger, and to make matters worse... Cronus is back.",
Cronus...King of the Twelve Titans...,
"Go, she is waiting for you in the Temple of Olympus right now.",
"Zeus, to this day, I can still feel your fear of me in your heart...",
"Cronus, no need to bluff. I know it's your soul in Athena's body.",
"Even though I don't have a body of my own right now, don't forget that I have far more combat experience than yours.",
"You once said something like that, but luck didn't seem to be on your side that time either.",
"Hmph... Do you think trickery counts as victory? If you fight me face to face, you have no chance of winning!",
"It's kind of ironic, you know? The goddess Athena you are currently possessing is an expert in wisdom and strategy.",
...,
"Whether it's through strategy or a frontal battle, I will never lose to you. Let's start this battle!",
Huh... I didn't expect your power to be this strong. Never before has a goddess stood against the power of a Titan...,
"How is this possible? Even though Cronus was defeated, Athena's soul has not woken up again...",
Don't think my soul is weak enough to dissipate so easily! I won't stop until I get a strong body!,
Hmph. So your ambition is nothing more than that.,
It seems my strength has been exhausted. I guess Athena's body is not as powerful as I thought.,
"But my soul still controls Athena's body. If you seal me away, Athena's soul will be imprisoned with me!",
(Use a trick to get Cronus' soul out of Athena's body),
"Cronus, you just want a strong body, right?",
That's right... I have been waiting for a powerful body that I can use to take back the throne for myself!,
"You don't have to wait, Cronus, if you're brave and courageous enough...",
...Just fight me in this dream.,
"Don't try to fool me a second time, Zeus. Do you think this duel is fair?",
"Hehe... In that case, I can use my Box to create a body identical to Lady Zeus'...",
This body is powerful enough to serve as a container for a Titan's soul. Do you know what this means?,
"So how about it? Same body, same strength. Do you have the guts to face me, second-generation King?",
"Don't regret those words, Zeus!",
"Come on, Cronus. Let us end this grudge that has lasted for thousands of years.",
This body and strength... are beyond my imagination...,
I will put an end to your madness this time. I won't hesitate any longer!,
Let's get started!,
"It's over, Chronos. This battle ends in my victory.",
"I can't believe this... Even with the same power, I still lost to you...Is this also Fate?",
"I don't know either. But over the next few tens of thousands of years, you can find the answer yourself, inside Pandora's Box.",
"Farewell, Lady Titan.",
"Hmph. Sooner or later, I will regain the authority of the God King... even if it takes another ten thousand years.",
I'll be waiting for that day.,
(Continue to activate the seal),
"Do you think you can threaten me? Cronus, why do you think I'm fighting you in Pandora's Dreamland?",
You... Could it be that this Dream...,
Did you finally figure it out? This entire Dreamland is under my control. Athena's soul will not be harmed.,
"How unfortunate, Cronus. It looks like you'll have to stay in the seal for a while longer.",
"I hope the scourge in my Box will be good entertainment for you over the next tens of thousands of years, Lady Titan.",
No... Zeus... I will not let you go!,
"Everything is finally over now. But what should I do if the seal is released again after tens of thousands of years, my dear?",
You can cross that bridge when you get to it.,

"Pandora, are you there?",
...Pisces. I knew something smelled fishy. Why the sudden visit to my Dreamland?,
I actually came to ask for your help.,
I can't shake this feeling that there's another me somewhere out there.,
I would ask if you're dreaming but...,
Can you use the power of the Dreamland to help me find her? I can hear her voice calling out to me.,
"I guess I can give it a try. But if you want to my help, then you first have to pass my test.",
,
Good. Then we can start.,
I didn't expect you to pass my test so easily...,
What do we do next?,
"Patience, darling. I will use my Box to try to see what exactly this other self of yours is.",
"Hmm... There is something. It doesn't look like you, but the soul is similar.",
Where is she?,
"Wait... Zeus is there too. If she's involved in this, things are going to get complicated.",
We'd better find a few reliable companions to join us before we set off. Got any good candidates?,
Reliable companions... Hmm. My sisters will help me.,
"We've been waiting for you, Pisces. The stars heralded your arrival, and also your reason for being here.",
"That doesn't surprise me. After all, the connection between us Zodiac sisters is still strong.",
We observed a powerful burst of energy in the Sea of Stars. It was the same as the divine power which you once possessed.,
"But it was full of confusion and fear, and desperate to let out the suppressed emotions in her heart.",
"I know, I've been hearing her call in my dreams, but I don't know how to help her.",
"So you came to Pandora's Dreamland, and you wish our aid.",
"But in this Dreamland, your power is weaker. Even with our help, you may not succeed.",
"I am confident in my own strength. If you have doubts, come at me.",
"It seems that even though you have lost most of your divine power, you are still powerful.",
I always have faith in my own strength.,
"Enough talking, you two. Who's next on the list?",
Capricornus. She always helps me when I'm in trouble. Can you connect to her Dream?,
"Piece of cake. But be careful, her Dream feels a little... angry.",
"Monsters, the Zodiac is not for the likes of you! Leave immediately!",
It seems that your sister... is not in a good mood today.,
"Oh no. Capricornus is suffering from hallucinations again. She cannot escape the nightmares of her past self, Pan.",
Does she think we are monsters invading the Zodiac again? We need to wake her!,
"Another fight, really? As the embodiment of the deep sea and eternal sleep, can't you be more gentle with your sisters?",
"The sea is not always calm, is it?",
...Pandora? Why are you here?,
Are you sane now? Your mind was trapped in Pan's nightmare again.,
"Maybe you should take a break from the Zodiac for a while. After all, Pan's power has left quite a shadow in your heart.",
I hope I didn't cause any trouble. But what brings you to the Zodiac to find me?,
We're searching for a goddess and need your power to help us travel through the Dreamland.,
"After all, having been the Goddess of Nightmares, you know the dream best out of the Zodiacs.",
"Although I am no stranger to dreams, I do not have the control I once did.",
"Don't worry, my dear. If you lose control again in the future, it will be our enemies who have run out of luck.",
Why have the Zodiac Signs broken into the Dreamland of the Greek Goddesses?,
"That's my line. Icarus, why are you in my domain?",
"Pandora, haven't you noticed the massive divine power raging out of control? The edges of the Dreamland have begun to crumble.",
"Wait a second... Pisces, your aura is the exact same as that divine power. Could it be that you...",
I know what you're thinking... But you've got it wrong!,
I will verify that myself!,
"Stop, I don't want to be your enemy. But as I thought, that out-of-control divine power is no different from your divine power.",
I swear I never thought of going against the Dreamland of the Greek Goddesses.,
Then what is the cause?,
"I believe that after the separation of my original divine power from my soul, it became a new goddess.",
"We are looking for her. We have the same purpose, so will you help us?",
"I have never heard of such a thing happening before. But if you really don't have any malicious intentions, then I will help you.",
That damn Zeus. Where has she gone this time?,
"If she doesn't apologize to me, I will leave and never come back!",
Uh... I think we'd better take a different route...,
Is that Queen Hera? Doesn't she stay in the Temple of Olympus? Why is she talking to herself in the dream?,
Don't ask... It's like this everytime Hera and Zeus have an argument.,
You there! What are you doing sneaking around?!,
"Oh great, she saw us. Here comes trouble.",
How dare you sneak into my dream and peep on me!,
"Ugh forget it. I'm in a bad mood, I'm not interested in fighting anymore with you.",
"My lady, an out-of-control goddess is wantonly destroying the entire Dreamland. Perhaps you can join us...",
"What does that have to do with me? If that goddess loves destruction, just let her destroy things.",
"Hmm, but I heard that Lady Zeus is in the Dreamland and has gone to see that goddess.",
...,
Is that right? I demand you take me to her. I swear her sweet dreams will soon come to an end.,
Heh... She's so simple.,
"Goddesses, I know why you are here. Please stop and listen to me.",
"Gaia, Goddess of the Earth, why are you in Pandora's Dreamland?",
Pisces of the Zodiac. You and this new goddess will begin to resonate if you go any closer.,
"Once the resonance begins, only one can survive while the other is sacrificed.",
What? Why?,
"Because you share the same origin. So the farther away you are, the weaker your connection will be, but when you get closer to each other...",
"Then the energy of one will completely devour the other, and that will trigger an unimaginable collapse.",
Is there any way to stop this from happening?,
Are you willing to give up the last of your divine power to reshape her body?,
Is there any other way? I don't want to lose my sister.,
"Well perhaps there is one way. The Essence of the Earth can be shaped into the body of a goddess, just as the oriental goddess Nuwa once did.",
But only someone with a strong will can control the Essence. Face me in battle and prove that you are capable of this.,
I will show you my resolve and determination.,
"You have proven yourself worthy to use the Essence of the Earth. But be careful, the closer you get to her, the more dangerous she becomes.",
"Thank you, Goddess Gaia. Do you have any ideas for dealing with this resonance, Pandora?",
"You can use my Box to create a new dream and separate your connection, but this is only temporary.",
"Please, Pandora, I just need a little time.",
Events predetermined by Fate are inevitable.,
"This barrier was made by Zeus. Stop immediately, or I will have to kick you out!",
"How strange that Apollo and Athena, who usually refuse to talk to each other, are actually standing side by side.",
I know why you are guarding Zeus' Dream. We're here to help.,
Do you think that empty words will convince us?,
I have the Essence of the Earth from Goddess Gaia. It will definitely help.,
"You plan to use the Essence of the Earth to shape a body for the goddess, and stabilize the soul that is out of control...?",
"That could work, Apollo.",
"I started this, so it's my responsibility to end it, no?",
"Sorry, we can't take that risk. Zeus' orders must be obeyed.",
Looks like the negotiations have failed. Such a pity.,
"If Fate is really on your side, then Athena and I will not be enough to stop you.",
Let's call there. I admit defeat. But you must still face Athena.,
"Lady Apollo, you didn't seem to be trying your best.",
No need to thank me. I just did what I thought was right.,
"Athena, it's been a long time since we last saw each other.",
"Indeed, we have not spoken a word to each other since the Trojan War.",
"Others do not recognize your true identity, but as the Goddess of Wisdom, you cannot hide from me.",
"I am not hiding. I am no longer Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. Now I am just Pisces.",
Well let's write off past grievances. Meaningless hatred is irrational.,
"We each have our burdens to shoulder, you must understand, right?",
"I will abide by the agreement. If you beat me, I will let you pass.",
You have won this battle. I will keep my word and let you pass.,
"Thank you for your understanding, Goddess of Wisdom.",
"As the former Goddess of Love, you should recognize who the deity deep within the dream is.",
I've more or less guessed it.,
Good luck then.,
Zeus! So this is where you've been hiding!,
"My dear, I'm not here on vacation. Anyone with a discerning eye can see that the dream is facing a disaster.",
The dream behind you is...,
"That's right. That is the dream of the Goddess of Love, born from your old divinity after you ascended to the constellation of Pisces.",
Her name is Venus. She is the Roman Goddess of Love. But she is on the verge of collapse due to her incomplete divinity.,
I have Gaia's Essence of Earth here. We can save her with it.,
"I'm afraid you're too late. Even with Pandora's Box isolating her dream, the two of you have already resonated.",
You must leave quickly. I will use my divine power to seal off this barrier and completely lock her in my dream.,
"But then she will be trapped here forever, suffering from her own power!",
This is beyond our ability to control. I must end her existence.,
"No, I have to try. It is my fault that things turned out like this.",
I must take responsibilty. Even if it means I will be destroyed with her.,
"Don't be stupid! Get out of here quickly, or I will stop you by force!",
"That's enough, stop. It seems that I cannot deny your will.",
"I'm sorry, Zeus.",
"I hope that your choice to save her yourself is correct. If you fail, the whole Greek Dreamland will collapse.",
All of it?!,
That's right. All the goddesses trapped in the dream will be destroyed. Do you understand the gravity of the situation now?,
"If you, like me, choose to seal her away in the dream, then this disaster will be averted and we will all be saved.",
"But I respect your strength, and will accept your decision. Make your choice.",
...Seal her away. I cannot put the Greek Goddesses in danger.,
"Although this is not a perfect choice, it ensures that the destruction of the Greek Pantheon is avoided.",
Olympus will remember her existence. May her soul rest in peace.,
i will save her.She also has the right to live!,
You chose the most difficult path. But perhaps this is your persistent will as the Goddess of Love.,
I will reopen the way to Venus' Dream for you. May Fate bless you.,
The former goddess Aphrodite... is that you?,
"After so long, have you finally remembered me? You tore me from your soul, abandoned me, ignored me.",
...,
But what is the use of me saying this now?,
"Corroded by darkness and pain, I can no longer control my power.",
"Venus, I have risked myself to come here and save you.",
Are you truly here to save me? Or are you simply afraid that my power will lead to the destruction of the gods?,
I am trying to take responsibility for my actions.,
"Come on then, let's end this.",
Venus' soul has been weakened. Now is the time for the Essence of the Earth to absorb her soul.,
"In the name of the Oath of Stars, may the Earth respond to the prayers of the gods...",
...,
Was I successful? She isn't responding to me.,
"The Essence of the Earth has reshaped her body, and Venus' soul has returned to its original state.",
"She will regenerate her own soul as a new goddess, and after thousands of years, then she will wake up.",
"This will be a long process, right?",
"You succeeded in saving her, and both the Greek and the Roman goddesses owe you thanks for that.",
"And her divine power that was out of control will return to you, allowing you to ascend to a higher level of divinity.",
I will make good use of this power that has returned to me. And I will wait for the day when she awakens.,
Well then. All's well that ends well. Let's leave the Dreamland now. My Box will guard her soul.,

Um hi? Do we know each other? My mystic shop is only open to acquaintances.,
Wow. Have you forgotten me already? That makes me sad. We met when you were helping Pisces.,
Oh! Are you that new goddess? Well in that case... Tell me what you need.,
"After being reborn, I have been travelling the world in search of some purpose for my existence...",
...in vain. So I've come to you for help,
Are you so sure I can help you?,
Well Pisces certainly thought so when I asked her.,
"So, it was Pisces who sent you to me. Then for her sake, I will give it my best shot.",
"But as is my custom, you must first pass my test... to prove that you won't lose yourself in the Dream again.",
"I'm not good at fighting... But if you insist, I'm not afraid to show you what I've got!",
"Although you have no actual skill in combat, you possess much power after your rebirth... I concede that you have passed.",
So what's next?,
I will use my divination to know whose dreams we should go to for answers.,
Let's see what destiny is revealed for you! Um... a rose?,
Did you say... a rose?,
I have no idea either. My divinations are usually rather straightfoward. Understanding them however...,
"Perhaps we should ask for help from Apollo, who also bears the gift of divination.",
"Apollo, long time no see.",
"Pandora, the Daughter of Disaster? To be honest, I don't really want to welcome you into my Dream.",
"Don't be so mean, my dear. I'm just here to ask you for a favor.",
I'm not sure what I can do to help you.,
"I received a revelation of Fate. It's pretty neat, you'll be interested in it.",
Your words are hard to believe...,
"Greek Goddess of Light and Prophecy, this revelation originates from me. Please believe that I am sincerely seeking answers from you.",
"You and I have never met, but... I have a feeling of familiarity, that your existence has a wonderful connection with the Greek Goddesses.",
"Interesting. I will help reveal your destiny, since it is my calling after all. But it won't be easy...",
I don't care what it costs me.,
"The form of divine power is the symbol of every deity. Show me your power, and everything will be clear.",
"That's not so difficult. What a faux pas, Goddess of Light!",
...Who are you? Why do you have such pure energy?,
"Oh, it turns out that even the Goddess of Prophecy has something she doesn't know.",
"Judging from the attributes of her divine power, she...is a new goddess born from lost divinity?",
"Yes, and this rose heralds her fate. But I can't understand it, maybe you can help me.",
"Roses are born in the south, symbolizing love... So perhaps her destiny is on the other side of the Dream.",
"Do you mean...the Roman Goddesses, those in the place of exile for the disqualified?",
Oh? You have this expression... as if you heard something that is taboo.,
You may not know it... but the Greek Goddesses have a secret in that place.,
You seem tense... Just what kind of secret is it?,
You will know when we get go there...,
"...I will go with you. After all, Dreams are much more dangerous than you can imagine.",
"Apollo! I have been looking for you for a long time! In the last archery competition, you actually got cold feet!",
"Oh it's Cupid, the little Roman Goddess of Love... Is this Fate or is it Pandora's doing?",
Hehe... I have no idea what you mean.,
Apollo is one of the strongest archers in Greece. I won't leave until she agrees to compete with me!,
,
"In any case, she'd be a good companion for us. That outfit might prove handy in battle, hehe.",
You... What are you talking about? What's with that look on your face?,
"I'm planning how to kidnap you, of course, my dear.",
Stop! I'm throwing in the towel!,
"Little cutie, are you the Messenger of Love from the Roman Pantheon?",
Um... You look very familiar. Have we met before? I have an inexplicible fondness for you.,
"No, we don't know each other... yet. Would you like to travel together? Perhaps we can get to know each other better.",
"Hmm let me think... Well, it's decided! Besides, this way, I will find another chance to challenge Apollo again.",
I have a bad feeling abou this.,
"Hehe don't worry... You're thinking too much. We have a long way ahead of us, so we'd better go quickly.",
It seems that this Dreamland's sea is not very welcoming. The sky is full of lightning.,
This is Storm Dragon's domain. And she's never been too fond of people flying over her head.,
"So we have to use a boat to cross? Any other great ideas, Pandora?",
"...If you don't mind getting wet, we could swim?",
...,
"What rare guests... Ladies, why are you visiting my ocean?",
"Your ocean? If I remember correctly, this ocean belongs to Storm Dragon.",
"Please don't change the subject, Lady Pandora. After all, you know Storm Dragon dislikse outsiders who disturb her.",
"Sorry, we just wanted to cross. We meant no offense.",
"Please don't get me wrong, I don't think you have any malicious intentions. But order and rules cannot be broken like this.",
You must prove to me that you have the qualifications to pass through Storm Dragon's domain.,
"I can understand that kind of order and rules, ma'am. So let's use our strength to decide!",
Your power is truly immeasurable.,
I don't need this kind of power. It means nothing to me. I just want to discover my own destiny.,
"Well, you can pass... But I'd afraid the Lady Storm Dragon will not be very happy. I'd better see you off personally.",
Up ahead... What's going on?,
"...Icarus. Wherever there's a storm, you'll find her.",
"I don't care who you are or why you're here, but please leave. The storm is dangerous.",
"It is you who should leave, Icarus. You know very well that this is Storm Dragon's domain.",
No one should create such a dangerous barrier. I must stop the storm here.,
"Lady Venus, can you help persuade her? If she persists like this, we can't even think about getting through here.",
"Icarus, if we can defeat you, it means we have the ability to stop this storm, don't you think so?",
Sounds like fun.,
"Then there is no need to say anything more, let's get started.",
You are much stronger than you look. Your divinity... is a bit different.,
"I am not the original goddess. My divinity comes from the former Greek Goddess of Love, Aphrodite.",
Can a divinity really give birth to a new existence? I've never heard of such a thing.,
"You have proved your own strength. But for the sake of safety, it is necessary for me to go with you.",
"Thank you for your kindness and mercy, Icarus.",
I was wondering why there's such a huge mass of energy gathered on the surface of the sea. It turns out I have some uninvited guests.,
"Sorry, we're just passing through these waters, Lady Storm Dragon.",
"Phew... Pandora. Even if I hid in the abyss of your dream, it seems that there is nowhere to go.",
There are always more surprises than expected... How about letting us pass through your domain now?,
The storm has always respected those brave enough to challenge it. So if you can beat me...,
Can't you be lenient with them?,
"This is the rule of the Dragon Clan from ancient times. No one can violate it, not even if Zeus herself was here.",
"I get it. It's a kind of a test, right?",
As you said.,
"The storm has receded, Dragon. It seems we have won the game.",
"What a strange power... Your soul is pure and flawless. It seems that you were born not long ago. Heh, a newborn Roman goddess...",
You seem to know a great deal about me...,
"I don't know that much, but you want to cross the ocean and head south, don't you?",
I need to go there to find the truth about my destiny.,
You're rather fun. I hope you find what you're looking for.,
There is a vortex in the sea not far ahead. That's the gate of the Underworld in the Dreamland.,
...I think I see someone that I don't really want to meet.,
This powerful force is... the Goddess Chaos?!,
"Welcome to the Underworld, Greek Goddess of Light, my mortal enemy, Apollo.",
"I really didn't want to see you, the source of all chaos and darkness.",
And... ah! You are the rumored newborn goddess. Why would you be interested in wandering around the Underworld?,
I'm afraid I have no obligation to tell you.,
,
I heard that the divinity of a Greek goddess would separate under some special circumstances to form an independent entity.,
"However, the newborn individuals could not find their place in Greece, so they went to live in that savage place.",
Savage place?,
"At least that's what the great Zeus once said, but let's get back to the point... I don't really want to stop you.",
But I'm curious to know how exciting it would be to have the sheer power of a newborn goddess like you...,
"Yeah? Well, why don't you come and experience the thrill yourself.",
"Chaos, in the dream, your power... seems to be not as strong as before.",
"At least we're having a good time, aren't we? As for you... newborn goddess Venus, dear, we will meet again.",
...,
"She's always been very difficult to deal with. It took the combined power of Zeus, Athena and I to barely drive her away.",
Pandora? Seeing you here... means that Chaos has left the Dreamland.,
"I was just wondering why it was the Goddess of Chaos who came to welcome us at the entrance of the Underworld, instead of you.",
She and I have never been close.,
No matter. We are here to seek permission to pass through the Underworld.,
"Of course, but you know the rules. What are you willing to exchange for the right to pass?",
"I know the rules of the Greek Underworld, Hades. I've also heard that you seem to like music?",
"That's true, someone touched my heart with the sound of the piano before. But now I'd like somethind different.",
Like...a battle that satisfies you?,
"Haha, really? Then I want to see what kind of strength you want to use to please me.",
Interesting! It's been a long time since I played against such a fun opponent. I will allow you to pass through the Underworld.,
"Before you leave, I have one more question - are you planning to go to Rome?",
"Yes, I heard that once there was a lot of newborn goddesses, like me, who went there.",
"Ah, that was so many years ago. Zeus was cursed in the fight against the Titan King.",
"This curse split the divinity of some Greek Goddesses in two, giving birth to mad souls.",
"After the war was over, those souls were unable to return. They couldn't find their place in Greece, so...",
"So, what?",
"Zeus thought it was necessary to find a place for them, and so Rome was built in a day. And they became the goddesses of Rome.",
Will this also be my fate?,
I'm afraid so.,
I see. Thank you for answering me.,
There's a light at the end of the tunnel. Are we almost at the exit?,
...I've had enough of the smell of death down here.,
"It's almost here, I can feel it. I'm eager to find out what the final destination of Fate is.",
"Venus, I'm afraid you'll have to get passed me again, to have a chance of getting to your final destination.",
Zeus! What are you doing here?,
"To be precise, I am a clone of Zeus left here. My duty is to guard this place and repatriate the gods who try to enter Rome.",
I don't understand. Why you would do this?,
We should not continue to provide Rome with new strength.They are already almost strong enough to rival Olympus.,
So you're just concerned about your power?,
I don't deny what you said. But they should recognize their position and realize that they are just a vassal pantheon of Greece.,
"You're too arrogant, Zeus...",
"Power is everything, Venus. And with true power, comes arrogance.",
Show me your power. The Ruler of the Greek Goddesses only recognizes the will of the strong.,
Your power is beyond my imagination. It seems that I will be unable to stop you.,
I just want to find my destiny.,
"I want to remind you that you still have the mark of Aphrodite on your body, so you will not be recognized by the Roman Goddesses.",
Aphrodite's mark?,
"That's right. If you want to completely remove her mark, you need to erase all ties to Greece.",
"But doing so will also completely erase your memories, including the time spent with your companions here, in the Dreamland.",
...What should I do?,
Accept and become a part of Greece; or face and sever the past. Make your choice.,
I don't want to forget my companions.,
I am glad that is your choice. The doors of Greece are always open for you.,
I will face my destiny.,
"I am sorry to hear you say that. But since you won, I shall respect your will.",
You will face Aphrodite's remaining power in Pisces. You must defeat her before the Roman gods will approve of you.,
I am ready.,
Venus... the other half of my divinity.,
"Pisces... No, it's not you. This is just a manifestation of the mark you left on my heart.",
"Are you really going to cut everything off to do with me? I care about you, so much so that I even risked my life to save you.",
I...,
"Come on, give up these absurd ideas and go back with me, back to Greece.",
"No, you're not Pisces! If it were her, she would definitely support me, no matter my decision!",
Do you really think so? I am disappointed.,
I'm ready. I'll defeat you and become a true member of the Roman gods.,
"Hehe, if that's the case, then bring it on.",
"You succeeded... Venus, you now have what they call freedom.",
This feeling of emptiness... is nostalgic.,
It's how I felt when I separated from you.,
"But now that you've proven your resolve, go to the land of your destiny.",
"I will not forget the help you gave me. This, at least, is my promise.",
"I hope that is true... May Fate watch over your future. Farewell, Roman Goddess of Love, Venus.",

"Odd, there seems to be a silhouette where it landed... Why does it look so familiar?",
...,
"Well, it seems the ever-watchful God of War, the ruler of Sparta, the protector of Greece, is having a bit of bad luck today.",
You seem quite pleased with yourself. Do you enjoy seeing others make a fool of themselves?,
Returning to the embrace of the Earth Goddess Gaia in such a manner is rather unexpected.,
Ares? Are you calling me? Is that my name?,
"Oh dear... Seems like you've taken quite the hit, forgetting even your own name?",
What's it to you? I don't recall us being close. Ah... my head hurts...,
"It should. In my dreams, you're no longer the invincible God of War.",
"You dare to mock me? When my sword descends upon your head, let's see if you can still laugh!",
"Hmph! Look at you, if your mouth wasn't so venomous, you wouldn't have taken that beating.",
"I didn't expect that after your fall and the injuries you sustained, you could still exhibit such combat prowess.",
What the hell have you done? Why did I suddenly fall into this godforsaken place?!,
"I did nothing. You fell from the sky and hit your head all on your own! Seriously, you're still as arrogant and conceited as ever.",
"But you must have some wish you want to fulfill, otherwise, you wouldn't appear in my dream.",
"A wish... I don't recall ever thinking about such things. Right now, I just want to leave this place as soon as possible.",
"If you can't remember, then don't dwell on it. The dream will guide you to find the correct exit.",
"Pandora, you'd better give me an explanation.",
The essence of the God of War is to challenge. Perhaps fighting with the mighty will jog your memory.,
"So, am I supposed to fight this guy in front of me? He doesn't look that strong...",
"Pandora, Ares, I don't recall sending invitations to either of you. Isn't it rude to come uninvited?",
"If it wasn't for something important, I wouldn't bother seeking you out, dear.",
"Important? Don't tell me you came here to pick a fight with me... Wait, why has Ares become so weak?",
She's lost her memory and also the power of the God of War. The dream guided us here.,
"So in the end, you hope she can recover her memory by fighting with me, right?",
"Well... She is one of the most significant gods in Greek mythology. Without her opposing those war mongers from Norse myths, there will be serious trouble.",
"I understand the danger behind this... Fine, I'll help.",
"If you all think this will help, I have no objections. After all, it's just fighting, doesn't matter who I'm beating up.",
"Sigh, it seems that even after a hard knock on the head, you've yet to learn any manners.",
...Is this the power I once had? It's truly overwhelming!,
It seems this method is working; the power is flooding back into you.,
"I'm glad our efforts weren't in vain. But honestly, I really don't like seeing her so smug.",
"Join us on our journey, Icarus. In the subsequent dreams, you can be of great help to us.",
"Alright, after all, it's better to keep an eye on a hothead like Ares...",
"My God, whose dream is this? The atmosphere is overly romantic...",
I'm also curious as to why you'd be led here. The master of this dream seems to like a good fight.,
Pandora? And Ares? Why are you guys in my dream?,
Don't tell me she's the so-called strong one? I feel like I could hold her head down with one hand...,
"Huh?! Did you hit your head, Ares? Just a few months ago, I had you running with your tail between your legs.",
"You guessed right; she lost her memory after falling into this dream, she can't recall many things.",
"Really? Hehe, she got what she deserved! I'm just sad that her annoying character wasn't completely forgotten.",
"The priority right now is to help her regain her memory, whether you like her or not.",
"Hmm, she's already forgotten how she lost to me last time. I guess it's necessary to remind her!",
"Talking won't get us anywhere, little one!",
"Stop, stop! How is this possible? Was I careless? You seem to be much tougher than last time...",
"Maybe I was just half-asleep last time, darling.",
You're definitely getting back your old vibe; that arrogant demeanor is almost shining through your eyes.,
"According to the Spartans' combat code, the loser has to fulfill a request made by the winner.",
What?! Is there such an unreasonable rule?,
This is the tradition of Sparta. My request is that you must join me in facing the troubles that lie ahead!,
Erm... I'd like to know if I have the right to refuse...,
Of course! You can either choose to follow me obediently to the next dream or get knocked out and be carried by me.,
...,
"Pisces, are you there?",
"Lately, you seem to be visiting my dreams quite frequently...",
Doesn't that just highlight your importance? I came for her.,
"The Goddess of War, Ares? Well... She doesn't seem unusual from the outside.",
"However, the situation is severe; I've lost most of my memories.",
Heh... It's a pity that her temper didn't vanish with them.,
I've heard some rumors that you were defeated in a battle with a certain goddess... Do you remember anything?,
"The moment I opened my eyes, I found myself in Pandora's dream and couldn't recall anything.",
"...You must have made a wish to Pandora's Box, and in order to fulfill that wish, the dream took away your memories.",
"To reclaim your memories, you must continuously fight within dreams and regain your divine status.",
"This doesn't seem like something I'd understand, but I've never refused a challenge.",
"Stop it, Ares; our power has reached its limit.",
"I feel a lot of my strength returning, but I also sense anger and fury...",
"This power will make you stronger, but it also brings recklessness and chaos, which will eventually harm you.",
"I don't care about those. After all, I've always believed that power is everything.",
"Sigh... I truly wish you could learn humility one day, at least towards your former companions.",
Apollo is a powerful warrior; battling him could help recover your memory and strength faster.,
"Apollo... that name rings a bell in my hazy memory. My sword is humming, craving a challenge.",
"As soon as you entered my dream, I felt the power within you, Ares.",
"Usually, your greeting when we met in the past was a hurled sword. I'm surprised you didn't do that today.",
"It seems we didn't get along in the past, huh? The radiance of your dream realm makes me uneasy...",
"Being the god of prophecy, I can't sense your past memories. It seems you've come to retrieve them.",
"I will provide guidance as it's only fair... Hopefully, once this is all over, you can learn some manners.",
Hmph... Bring it on. Let's see if your sunlight blinds or if my blazing fire burns hotter.,
Helping an old enemy regain his strength is an odd sensation.,
"From our battle, I sensed a powerful sense of order...",
"That's precisely where my strength comes from, in direct contrast to the chaotic, violent power you used to revere.",
"With the return of your power, the chaotic and violent spirit of your past will inevitably come back, though I'd rather it didn't...",
"I don't care. If my past self was powerful enough to crush everything, that's fine by me.",
"Unfortunately, chaos and fury don't necessarily mean the strongest.",
"Hmph, interesting. If it were the me before I lost my memories, I probably would've retorted without hesitation.",
"But now, I'm a tad curious about what you're saying.",
"Good, I'll be by your side, watching to see how fate guides you this time...",
"The Underworld. I must've been here more than once. I remember the aura here, the cold of death.",
"That's right. You used to frequent this place. After all, war brings death, so we've always had... collaborations.",
But I believe that you no longer have the qualifications to command wars now. Such a pity.,
"You better treat me with respect, or I can't guarantee I won't accidentally reduce this place to ashes.",
"Heh... When you were the god of war, I believed you could. But with your current strength... I'm not so sure.",
"Hmph, I'm here because I heard you could help me retrieve my memories and strength, to reclaim past glories.",
"Your tone remains as commanding as ever... Fine, considering our past, let's make a deal.",
A deal?,
"Simple. I want you to wage war on the Norse, guiding the souls of the Norse warriors to the Greek Underworld.",
Why does this deal sound familiar?,
Exactly. Because it's something we agreed upon before you lost your memories.,
"I can accept this deal, but how it's executed will be up to me.",
"Of course, it's your call, as long as... you prove you're still as strong as you once were.",
Uh... I can feel my memories slowly returning with each battle...,
,
"So the question is, Ares, do you remember why you fell from the heavens?",
Athena... Why does her image come to mind...?,
"Heh... Maybe you should return to Olympus. Although your relationship with Athena is complex, perhaps she isn't responsible for this.",
Ares? How did you...,
"Chaos, was it you...?",
"Impossible... Didn't you fall into the depths of the dream abyss, becoming mortal?",
"It seems you know something, dear. Maybe it's not too late to tell me.",
Put away your arrogance. I'm under no obligation to answer your questions.,
"However, it seems you've gained new powers in the dream realm... I'm quite interested in your power...",
Would you like to experience it firsthand?,
"An interesting proposition. If you can defeat me, I'll tell you everything that happened before...",
"This ends now, Goddess of Chaos. Your power cannot prevent my victory!",
Your fighting style has... refined quite a bit from before. The old you would never have faced an enemy's attack so calmly...,
Enough talk! Tell me everything you know.,
"I'll give you a clue. Not long ago, through the Eye of Chaos, I saw you with Zeus and Athena in the realm of Olympus.",
"...It seemed like you had a dispute over something, but what it was, I have no idea.",
It seems I wasn't wrong in my assumptions. I'd better go to Zeus for answers.,
"Ares, I'm glad to see you return unscathed. I was quite worried when you fell into the abyss of the dreamscape.",
"Tell me everything you know, Zeus! Was I attacked by Athena?",
What are you talking about? How could such a thing happen?,
Then I guess I'll have to go directly to Athena and get some clarity.,
"With that anger on your face, it doesn't seem like you're just going for a conversation. If you cause trouble, it won't be good for the gods.",
Don't stand in my way. I must know the reason for everything that happened!,
"Enough, Ares. If you're set on seeking answers from the goddess of wisdom, I know I can't stop you.",
But I hope you won't resort to violence as you used to.,
I'm merely seeking the truth.,
"Alright... At least, compared to before, there's a hint of order and reason in your eyes now. I hope I'm not mistaken.",
"Come out, Athena! If you continue to hide, I'll tear down your temple!",
I hope you remember Zeus's warning. At least... don't forget it so quickly...,
I can't recall offending you again. I hope you'll explain.,
What did you do to strip me of my power and memory and then throw me off Olympus?,
What are you talking about? How could I do such a thing!,
It seems only swords can clarify this for me!,
"Oh my, I should have seen this coming...",
You lost. Tell me everything you know!,
You've actually started to use tactics. How surprising.,
"Brute force doesn't solve everything... Be honest with me, what happened with my fall into the dreamscape abyss?",
"I have absolutely no idea what... wait, now I remember! Thor from the North once visited Greece not long ago.",
"Thor, the god of thunder? What did she want?",
She was searching for the one who stole the souls of the Norse warriors.,
The souls of Norse warriors? Damn... could it be the deal I made with Hades?,
Are you hiding something from me? Or did you strike some deal with him?,
"I only know I made a deal with him, but I've forgotten the specifics!",
"I might have a solution. In the dreamscape, I can summon Thor's soul. Perhaps that could clarify everything.",
Forget it. I've got nothing to discuss with her.,
Sigh... Maybe that's not a bad thing. Every encounter with the Norse gods usually doesn't end well.,
I guess this is the only way to figure everything out.,
As you wish.,
Who is summoning the thunder?!,
"It's me, the Greek god of war, Ares! Thor, did you cast me into the dreamscape abyss?",
It's you?! I didn't expect you to crawl out of that abyss.,
"So it was you! Thanks to you, I've suffered quite a bit.",
You and Hades conspired to steal the souls of the Norse warriors. I was just executing justice!,
I remember now... Zeus and Athena once discussed with me the territorial divisions with the Norse realm.,
Exactly. The Norse gods agreed that the strongest would harbor more souls. You were chosen to represent the Greek warriors and battle against me.,
"But in the end, due to Hades' interference on the battlefield, we couldn't determine a victor.",
"We had no choice but to consider the Greek gods as oath-breakers. Eventually, in the chaos of battle, you were cast down from the divine realm.",
So that's what happened.,
"Even though Hades didn't succeed in the end, I still wish to continue the challenge with the Greek gods.",
I get what you mean. Draw your weapon!,
It seems like it would be hard for me to beat you in a head-on battle...,
"The same tricks won't work on the god of war twice, Thor.",
You indeed qualify to lead more warrior souls. The current you is much different from before you lost your memory.,
"Regarding the division of realms between Greek and Norse warriors, I think we can discuss it again.",
"Before that, I need to settle some scores with Hades...",

"Solemn secrets and the goddess of knowledge, Pandora, I summon you in the name of the Nordic Thunder God! Heed my wish!",
Oh my! Who's calling me at this time? Can't you see I'm in the middle of my beauty routine?,
,
,
"I have countless gold and jewels at my disposal, name your price and it's yours.",
Deal. Let's get started then. Show me what you've got and we'll see if you're worthy of my services.,
"I trust you've witnessed the full extent of my power, Pandora. Do you deem me worthy?",
"Alright, you've proven yourself. Let's use the crystal ball to foresee where your hammer was last seen.",
"This is... I believe you should recognize this angel, Thor.",
"Damn it, it's Loki! I knew she had something to do with this!",
"Loki, I know you're here. Show yourself, or I'll electrify this entire house!",
I'm coming out... just don't destroy anything in my collection room.,
Return my hammer.,
Hammer? What hammer... uh.,
Don't play innocent with me. I saw everything in Pandora's crystal ball.,
What? You guys used a crystal ball to pry into others' secrets? You're such villains!,
Stop changing the subject and give me back my hammer.,
"Heh, if you're so powerful, why don't you come and take it?",
"Uh... I'm really sorry, but I broke your hammer... shattered it into many pieces and gave them away.",
"Heh, for starters, the hammer handle was given to the Valkyrie. If you're lucky, you can get it back before it's turned into an axe handle.",
"Hey there, what brings you around, Thor? You're usually so busy.",
Let's cut to the chase. Didn't Loki give you a wooden handle recently?,
"Ah, that one? Is it yours? I assume you've come to reclaim it?",
"If you feel like you're losing out, I can trade it for some treasures.",
"I'm not interested in treasures. Just spar with me for a bit, and I'll return it to you.",
"Valkyrie, can you return my hammer handle now?",
"Of course, take it. You've earned it.",
"Who dares summon the great god of death? Oh, little Loki, what brings you here this time?",
"Heh... so, about that shard I gave you last time, the one that sparks and buzzes. Can I have it back?",
"It's now on display in my cabinet. You wish to reclaim it? Hahaha, what makes you think I'd agree to that?",
"Excuse me, Lord of the Dead, I hope you can return it to me. It's of utmost importance.",
"I've heard of you, Thunder God Thor. I'm willing to return your treasure, but I have a request: battle me.",
"You've won, it was a fair fight! I'm satisfied. Take what you came for.",
"Thank you for your generosity, Anubis.",
"Greetings, Norse goddesses. Oh, you're Thor, the Thunder God. Are you here to reclaim a fragment of your hammer?",
"Indeed, I suppose retrieving it from you won't be easy.",
"No, on the contrary, we Egyptian deities are known for our generosity. However, I do have a small favor to ask.",
I've crafted a new staff and I'm looking for a powerful goddess to test its might. Most Egyptian angels are a bit delicate...,
"Not an issue. When it comes to physical strength, I'm unrivaled in Norse mythology!",
How was it?,
Not quite ideal. The crystal portion needs enhancement and the staff itself is too heavy; most angels might struggle to wield it.,
"... Regardless, I appreciate your assistance in testing. Here, take the shard. It's indeed a fine material.",
"Thor, the Thunder God? A rare visitor indeed. How's Odin? When you see her, do send my regards.",
"Greetings, Ra. I'm here to reclaim a fragment of my hammer.",
"A shard? Are you referring to the piece Loki gave me? Sure, but I have a challenge for you.",
"I accept your challenge, Ra.",
"Excellent, let's begin then.",
You've passed my test and lived up to my expectations. Here's your prize.,
"I appreciate your understanding and generosity, Ra.",
"Pandora, you'd better have a good reason for bringing these outsiders into my territory.",
"I apologize for the intrusion. I am Thor, the Norse God of Thunder. I have urgent business with Zeus.",
What business? Report it to me directly.,
All you Greek gods are so arrogant. Don't you have any manners?,
Manners? Do they make one stronger? All I desire is power!,
"Not bad, not bad at all. You managed to make me back down.",
"You're quite impressive yourself, Ares, and you didn't even use your full strength.",
"Hmph, I acknowledge your strength. Go on, Zeus is waiting for you in the Pantheon.",
"I've anticipated your arrival, Norse God of Thunder, Thor. Allow me to reforge your hammer.",
"It's an honor, great God of Light, Apollo... I have all the fragments here.",
Lift up the shards of your hammer. I will reignite its core with the heat of the sun.,
"Be careful, its core still possesses a strong magnetic field.",
"Ah, it's too heavy...",
The sun's heat has added gravity to its core. You'll need to get used to it again.,
"This hammer is currently just a raw form. It needs to be blessed by Zeus's lightning for its rebirth. Go on, Zeus is waiting for you.",
"Welcome to my domain, Thor, God of Thunder. Apollo has informed me of your intentions for this visit.",
"Apollo has already helped me forge the raw form of the hammer. Now, I wish to request you to temper it with your lightning.",
"That won't be an easy task, Thor.",
"No matter how difficult the process, I believe I can handle it!",
Then raise your war hammer and feel every bolt of lightning I send your way!,
"You've succeeded, Thor. It's been completely reforged, even more powerful than before.",
"Thank you, Lord Zeus.",
"I have a small gift here, if you're willing to accept it.",
What is it?,
"A thunder orb. It's perilous, even I can barely control it. If you wish, I can embed it into your hammer.",
"If even you struggle with such power, then it would be even more dangerous in my hands.",
"Alright, I understand your concerns. Let's discuss this once you've further honed your skills.",
I will master this power and make it the sharp spearhead of Asgard!,
"Be cautious then. I'm about to unleash its inner force, and you must resist it before embracing it.",
Who dares attempt to unleash this world-destroying thunder? That power belongs to the dragon clan. You shall not touch it!,
I was just looking for a way to test the power of this hammer. I believe a dragon's head should be tough enough!,
"I have won, the power of this orb is mine!",
Your victory will be spoken of throughout the dragon clan. Don't celebrate too soon; other mighty dragons will soon challenge you.,
"Let them come as they please. For now, I just wish to quietly accept this newfound strength.",
"Indeed, embrace the power of the orb and then ascend.",
Sigh. I was kicked out by Amaterasu again. She's so stubborn! Telling me to reconsider the meaning of fate.,
"I see you hiding alone in the bamboo forest, feeling sorry for yourself. The moon is beautfiful tonight, why don't you come out and look?",
Who are you?,
"Let me introduce myself - I am Pandora, the Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge. I am the one who always ends up solving the problems of goddesses.",
Are you really able to do that? Then can you help me find the meaning of fate?,
"If the price you offer is good enough, I won't be able to refuse. Of course, you have to show me see your strength first.",
"This should be enough, right?",
"Hmm, not bad, a little better than I expected. Okay, we have a deal.",
"Cupid, I have a job for you.",
"What do you want, Pandora?",
I am here today for this Eastern goddess. Please listen to her request.,
"I am Enmusubi from the Yamato Clan. Nice to meet you, Cupid. I would like to ask you about the meaning of fate. This is very important to me.",
"Fate is the stepping stone to happiness, the pulling thread of love, and the light that guides my arrow.",
Would you like to demonstrate it to me?,
Of course.,
"Enmusubi, do you get it now?",
"Thank you for your guidance, Cupid.",
"Who is that noble goddess in the distance? Oh my gosh, she is so beautiful!",
"She is Venus, the Goddess of Love and Beauty, and the mother of Cupid. You can ask her about fate.",
"My fairies have conveyed the news of your arrival to me. Nice to meet you, everyone.",
Can I ask you about fate?,
Of course.,
"Fate is an eternal connection between blood, a family relationship that cannot be severed, just like Cupid and I.",
"I understand. It is a kind of hidden power, a bond that cannot be changed by external forces!",
"That is correct, Enmusubi.",
"Pandora, are you here to meet Zeus?",
I brought this Eastern goddess to you. She has some questions and needs your guidance.,
"Your Majesty, Queen Hera, I would like to ask you about the true meaning of fate.",
"Fate? Hmm this must be what your culture refers to it as. We Greeks called it destiny. No matter love or hate, we are all guided by destiny.",
"In my opinion, as long as I like something, I must pursue it relentlessly and hold my destiny firmly in my hands.",
"It seems that you have understood the Greeks' understanding of fate, and I hope that will become part of your understanding of fate.",
"Thank you for your guidance, Lady Hera.",
"Welcome to Asgard, hehe... Are you also here to seek guidance on love?",
"Be careful, Enmusubi. Frigga can be... unpredictable.",
"It doesn't matter, she is just a fool who is obsessed with love. As long as I am here, she will not hurt you.",
"I would like to ask your opinion on fate, Lord Frigga. If you don't mind, please give me some guidance.",
"Oh, fate...that is a promise that lasts until death, and a love that lasts forever.",
"Even if you resist, you can't escape from this choice of love.",
"I can understand your thinking, but this is too extreme.",
"In any case, thank you for your teaching, Lady Frigga.",
"Welcome, My children, it is a pleasure to see you visiting Me. Oh... there's a new face here, welcome, welcome.",
"Mother Goddess Gaia, this is Enmusubi from the East, she wants to seek guidance from you.",
"Lady Gaia, I would like to ask you what fate is.",
"Ah, fate... Fate is the expectation of childbirth, the bond of blood, and the first pulse that gives birth to everything.",
"Perhaps I should guide you myself, come, goddess of the East.",
"I think I understand what you mean, thank you, Lady Gaia.",
"There are more guides awaiting your exploration ahead, go, Enmusubi.",
Rabbit? How come you're here?,
"Chang'e said... Sister Chang'e wants to break off her relationship with me, boohoo!",
Why does she want to break up with you?,
,
"Anyway, you have to help me, or I'm going to lose my best friend!",
"You and Fairy Chang'e have an inseparable bond of friendship, and you will definitely get back together!",
"I feel relieved to hear you say that, hee hee!",
"Fairy Chang'e, turns out you're here.",
"Ah, it's Enmusubi, have you seen Rabbit? I accidentally pissed her off.",
"I just saw her. Oh, she is looking for you too.",
Is she still mad at me? I shouldn't have been so harsh to her.,
"Rather than being mad, she is very afraid of losing you. Go find her.",
I want to have a heartfelt talk with her.,
Just remember to be gentle and don't scare her away again.,
"You're back, Enmusubi. I hope you've found the answer you were looking for.",
"You were right, Lady Amaterasu. My understanding of fate is too shallow. I have learned a lot on this journey.",
"Fate is not only related to love, but also to family and friendship.",
"I'm glad you realize this, but your trial is not over. You must prove to me that you have the power to control fate.",
"You have done well. As Ruler of the heavenly realm Takamagahara, I now restore your status as the God of Fate",
"Thank you, Your Majesty Amaterasu. Actually I still have one regret...",
"Tell me, Enmusubi.",
"I once made a mistake in a marriage, which turned into a tragedy. That is the fate of Kaguya.",
"If given the chance, would you like to correct this regret?",
I don't think I have the courage to face her...,
"You're not ready, maybe you should wait until a better time.",
I will give her true happiness!,
I will summon her so that you may fulfill this promise.,
"Kaguya, Daughter of the Moon, heed my call and come to me.",
"I answer your call, Lady Amaterasu.",
Enmusubi wants to undo the tragedy of your marriage and make you truly happy.,
"If you are willing to give me a chance, I would like to create a new marriage for you.",
"I am willing, but you must first remove the red rope that binds my body.",
I... I succeeded.,
"Congratulations, you successfully solved Kaguya's evil fate. Congratulations to you too, Kaguya, you are no longer bound by the past.",
"Thank you, Enmusubi.",
"With this, I can return to my own divine realm, with peace of mind.",

The results of this competition are still pending,
Hahaha! Do you think there's a need for a signature victory pose for my warriors?,
Doesn't seem necessary.,
Absolutely! I'd love to see that!,
"The legions of Sparta will, under my leadership, conquer all of Greece sooner or later!",
I doubt Athena would see it that way.,
Do you need my assistance?,
"I couldn't care less about her. If she still considers herself a warrior, she should face me in open battle!",
"Hmph, you may not look like much of a fighter, but I respect your courage and determination as a warrior.",
"As a formidable warrior, one must train at least twelve hours a day!",
And what about the rest of the time?,
Isn't that a bit excessive?,
"Off to the tavern for a drink, or perhaps to the arena for a brawl. Of course, marching with my army to give Athena a little shock wouldn't be too bad either.",
"Trust me, once you've faced setbacks on the battlefields of Troy, you wouldn't think that way.",
"One day, I'll prove to everyone that Ares is the only one deserving of the title 'God of War'.",
Are you that concerned with a title?,
I believe you'll achieve it in time.,
"Of course! Titles represent honor, and honor is the only true testament of a warrior's existence.",
"I must have the final say in everything, even in love. It should be on my terms!",
Do you even understand the meaning of love?,
Perhaps you're right.,
"Ah, that's quite the question. I think it'd be best discussed with you, privately in a room tonight...",
"Of course, all my lover needs to do is lay in my arms or lean on my shoulder.",
"Once, during a showcase in the realm of the gods, when it was my turn, I went on stage and brawled with every guest.",
The highlight? I personally gave Hera a 'new hairstyle'.,
That's hardly a performance.,
That must have been quite the spectacle...,
"Really? Well, what else would you expect the God of War to showcase apart from fighting?",
"Hmm, you might be right. After all, the valor of our warriors already leaves a lasting impression on our foes.",
"How about this? After a victory, they shout 'This is Sparta!' and then kick the enemy away. How's that for an idea?",
"Hmph, you have a good eye. With someone as wise and brave as you by my side, it won't take long to dominate all the pantheons.",

"Ah, it's a new day again. It's a shame that I feel so bored as soon as I get out of bed. I need to find something interesting to do.",
"Please forgive my intrusion, but you seem troubled. How about letting me, Pandora, be of service to you?",
"You don't seem like a boring person. If you can amuse me, that would be a good appetizer for a morning.",
"I might be capable of many things, but I won't play the role of a clown for entertainment.",
Then what can you do? Rub your hands together and tell a few jokes?,
I can make others be the clowns.,
"Haha, you've got a point there. But I am genuinely curious about what you can do. Let's see how you'll do it.",
"Very well, but as per my usual practice, I need to verify your skills first.",
"How about that? My tricks should be somewhat impressive, right?",
"For a trickster god, you're not bad at all.",
"Next victim is going to be pranked by me? Come on, give me some ideas, Pandora.",
"Have you seen that beautiful girl? I heard her name is Sif, known for her gorgeous hair.",
"Sif, hehe, that's right, her hair is really beautiful!",
Let's go and cut it off.,
"That's a great idea! Hey, Sif, I'd like to make a deal with you!",
"Everyone knows you're a little trickster, Loki, I'm not making any deals with you!",
"You see, I had the dwarves specially craft a golden comb just for you. Come on, use it to comb your beautiful hair.",
"Wow... it's so beautiful, can I really use it to comb my hair?",
"Oh! What's happening? My hair! Loki, you deceiver! My hair is all gone!",
Give my hair back!,
"Don't worry, I'll find a better container for them. Hehehe!",
"Oh, dear, we're so naughty! Loki, you're really naughty!",
"Do you know Thor's hammer, Loki? I've always wondered if that hammer can be used to power my house.",
"You're not thinking of taking Thor's hammer, are you? You need to strategize that carefully. Look, here she comes.",
"Loki, can't you just stay in your own house and not wander around? I see you, and I just want to give you a beating!",
Why don't you give me a beating then? I can help you polish the hammer with my smooth skin.,
"That's a great idea, let's get started.",
Ah! My hammer!,
"I forgot to tell you, anything locked in Pandora's box, no one can ever open it!",
You damn guy!,
"Now, I'm leaving Asgard because you guys can't please me anymore, hehehe.",
"Do you see that? It's Icarus. If I were to play a prank on someone, I'd definitely pick her first.",
Let's go and pluck her feathers!,
"Goddess Icarus, it's nice to meet you, but at the same time, I'm sorry because you're about to lose your ability to fly very soon.",
I don't know you. What do you mean by that?,
"I want to pluck your feathers, hehehe!",
You're quite the strange fellow. I don't want to fool around with you.,
My feathers! They're all gone...,
That's great; now you can relive the days of walking with just your legs.,
"That garden, if I'm not mistaken, must belong to a perfect goddess.",
"That's Athena's garden. Oh, by the way, she has some beautiful fish. If we could catch a few...",
We won't have to worry about dinner that night!,
"Who allowed you to enter my garden, foreign gods! And you, Pandora!",
"Oh my, it seems the garden's owner has arrived. Shall we play a big game and tease her?",
"Tease me? You better be careful. I, Athena, am one of the finest warriors in all of Greece.",
"True, you are indeed as formidable as the rumors suggest, but while you were busy with me, my decoy has already done its job, hehe.",
"Dammit, my fish!",
"I heard Olympus had a troublesome little guest, causing mischief everywhere. Let me see what kind of troublemaker you are.",
"You have a vibe quite similar to Odin, I guess you're the head honcho of the Greek pantheon, right?",
"Although I'd love to ask you to put in a good word with Odin, I'm pretty sure anything coming from your mouth would be tainted.",
"Hehe, I am the god of deception and pranks.",
"Come on, show me your tricks and let me see your talent for playing tricks on people!",
"Oh, you really got me there. I almost fell for it.",
"Give me one more chance, and I'll do better, I promise.",
"No, no, no... I think it's unnecessary. Speaking of pranks, I have a recommendation for you. Head east and seek out a goddess named Fuxi.",
"Is she clever? Well, I can't wait to find out.",
"Oh, you scoundrels! You dare to steal my things!",
"Oh my, this lovely little ornament is quite nice. With some polishing, it could even be used for dining.",
"That's not for dining; it's my hairpin, you fool!",
"I say it is, so it is, hehe.",
Give it back to me quickly!,
"Flatten the front a bit and open a fork in it, it's the perfect plan!",
My hairpin...,
"Hey, what's this thread? It's red and there are so many of them...",
I guess this must be what the Easterners call 'the thread of destiny.',
"Oh, I've heard of that. It means if you connect both ends, even a pig and a cow can fall in love.",
Let's use our imaginations to see how many possibilities are hidden in this!,
Stop it! What are you doing? You're ruining the destiny I carefully arranged!,
"Manipulating emotions is as unpleasant as manipulating fate, but at least I can make the world a bit less boring.",
Rabbits and horses... ladybugs and snails... Look at the mess you've caused! Now the world is in chaos!,
"Don't you see, that's what makes it interesting? The world is so colorful because of all these different possibilities.",
"It seems our actions have caused quite a stir, even roused the big shots behind the scenes. Oh, I'm quite remarkable, Pandora.",
Look at that proud expression of yours; you should focus on the challenges ahead.,
,
"I don't dislike you. In fact, I find your methods quite in tune with human nature and quite creative.",
"I actually received recognition? Thank you, but I didn't come here seeking validation. Well, let's get to the exciting part, shall we?",
"There are two patterns behind me, one black and one white. If you can turn white into black and black into white, you win.",
Is that all? It's too easy!,
"There, I did it! Now black has become white, and white remains white. You've lost, Fuxi.",
"Shall we look at the patterns reversed? This way, black stays black, and white remains white.",
Ah... you... you cheated!,
"I just wanted to tell you that sometimes, things that seem to be destroyed might have just been sent to the other side.",
"They never change, and they never truly perish. That's balance.",
I... I think I understand something now.,
"If you want to discern the truth, seek balance, you must grasp the path of harmony. Are you willing to perceive this harmony?",
"It sounds intriguing. If I can find pleasure on this path, I see no reason to refuse.",
"I'm delighted you're willing to accept this concept. Now, let's watch with anticipation.",
"Next, I will use the art of Yin and Yang harmony to create an opposing version of you. Perhaps when facing her, you will gain a deeper understanding.",
Let's begin!,
Who are you talking to? Another me.,
"Are you my opposite? Well, it seems you're not much better than me, just as negative. Quite interesting, I must say.",
"You're right; it is interesting... But for some reason, I still can't like you.",
I feel the same way.,
"Well, how about we settle this with a fight? The winner gets to replace the other.",
"Now, things are getting interesting.",
I won! Hehe!,
"Oh, really? Then may I ask, which one of the two Lokis are you?",
"Of course it is... me? Strange, I can't answer that question because from either Loki's perspective, I'm the one who emerged victorious.",
"No matter which version of you, you're still you, and everything you experience, the opposing version of you is also going through simultaneously.",
Is this the way of harmony? I think I understand now.,
"It sounds a bit tedious. Oh well, it's about time to head home.",
"I truly empathize with your feelings, and if one day you figure it out, know that I'm here, always ready to welcome you back.",

"What is this sound? So enchanting, so wonderful... There might never be such music like this in the world again.",
"Pandora, are you there? I want to know where this music is coming from.",
Music? What music? I haven't heard anything.,
"Am I the only one hearing it? Let me play it for you to listen... Strange, why can't I play this melody?",
"I've heard of a timeless sound, a lost melody that can only be learned by finding its source.",
"Please take me to find it, wherever it may be...",
"Of course, but before that... although I'm not worried about your abilities, I still need to test you according to the tradition.",
"All right, the power of the sun god is truly immeasurable. So, let's set out to find the origin of this music.",
"I'm counting on you for everything, Pandora.",
Cupid's palace? Can she possibly have information about that melody here?,
"As we all know, Cupid is also a great musician.",
I heard someone praising my greatness.,
"No, you heard wrong, Cupid, we're just talking about music.",
"Who else in all of Greece knows music better than me? Oh, Apollo, you wouldn't want to claim it's you, would you?",
"How arrogant! Bring out your seven-stringed lyre, and let's compete in music!",
"Wait, the piece you just played, where did you learn it from?",
"I came across it by chance... in fact, the piece I played is just a fragment.",
I apologize for the interruption. I have some questions regarding music that I'd like to ask you. Have you ever heard such a melody?,
"This haunting melody, this mournful sound of the strings, it's... it's the voices of the departed!",
Do you know its origin?,
"Do you wish to find it? If you can surpass me in musical skill, I will personally guide you to trace its source.",
"I believe I've won this challenge, Capricorn.",
"Indeed, your musical talent surpasses mine. It's time for me to fulfill my promise.",
"If you seek the voices of the departed, you must journey to Egypt. There, I believe you will find what you seek.",
"If anyone can come close to the voice of the departed, it must be Anubis.",
"Greetings, divine beings.",
"Greetings, Anubis. I have a melody I'd like to ask you to identify. Can you tell me where it originates from?",
I'd like to hear it.,
"This is... I've heard this melody before, right over the boundless River of the Underworld.",
Could you please guide me to the source of this melody?,
"No, that is an evil sound. It would lead the souls that should be in the cycle of reincarnation astray on the River of the Underworld!",
"I'm sorry, Anubis. If you're unwilling to take me there, please at least provide me with a direction.",
"Entering the Underworld like this, you are certain to get lost. If you insist on going, I will guide you.",
"The sound of the lyre just now was truly enchanting. Was it your performance, Greek goddesses?",
"Indeed, it was our performance, but we are not the ones who composed it. In fact, we are currently searching for its origin.",
Oh! Would you be willing to take me along as well? I'd love to hear the original composer of this piece play it in person.,
"Certainly, we welcome like-minded companions at any time.",
"Before that, I have a request - I happen to be a lyre enthusiast myself, and I'd love to have a musical duel with you.",
"No problem, please, go ahead and showcase your skills.",
"Your lyre playing is unmatched, Apollo. I concede.",
"You're not bad yourself, Horus.",
"If this melody truly hails from the underworld, then I believe only Lord Hades can unveil the origin behind the veil of the River Styx.",
"Indeed, I have crossed the Styx three times, and I can guide you on this path.",
"Crossing the River Styx is no easy feat, Apollo, especially for one as radiant as you. But I have a trial...",
"If you pass this trial, I will bestow a spell upon you, one that will temporarily disguise you as a departed soul. The ferryman Charon will then transport you across.",
"I accept your trial, Lord Hades.",
"You have passed the trial, Apollo. Now, I will cast the disguise spell upon you.",
My radiance has faded...,
"It is only temporary; once you find what you seek, the spell will naturally dissipate.",
"It seems that even in the afterlife, some dare to intrude. You all must be truly impatient. Oh, that seems quite fitting for me as well.",
"Lady Dragon, I've come to find a lost melody fragment.",
"It's truly strange. Nowadays, there are people in the afterlife searching for all sorts of things - friends and family, lovers, and even music.",
It's a pity that the ferryman Charon fled at the sight of me. Perhaps you'll have to find your own way across this river.,
Or maybe not. Isn't there a dragon here?,
Are you suggesting that I carry you across the river? How absurd. I will make you pay for your arrogance!,
I truly wish you would sit down and listen as I play a tune. Not everything in this world needs to be resolved through combat.,
"Say what you will, for I have lost to you. But don't get too smug; I will reclaim my honor from you!",
"Oh my, let me see, who has fallen from grace to this lightless place?",
,
"This time, the sun's radiance will not protect you. You will be imprisoned at the end of eternity by this perpetual mist.",
"I don't agree, Chaos. My music will guide me through this darkness and lead me to a way forward.",
Then let's see who will prevail in the end.,
"It appears that this time, I am the victor.",
"Hmph, having more people on your side doesn't make you more skilled!",
"It appears that guests from my realm have arrived, and they are no ordinary guests; they are a group of renowned goddesses.",
"You see, it's not easy to have so many heavenly visitors in the Underworld all at once. I must ask you to stay a while longer.",
"I'm afraid we might have to disappoint your kindness, Hades. I've come here only to seek a melody lost in the waters of the Styx.",
"Oh? Searching for music? It seems you understand me, Apollo. I am, after all, a devoted music enthusiast.",
Shall we compare our performances? I hear you have a lovely seven-stringed lyre in your collection.,
I would be delighted to oblige!,
"The music you play... it hails from Orpheus, the finest musician Greece has ever known.",
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting her. Do you happen to know where she is now? I would love to learn from her musical talents.,
"Unfortunately, she disappeared into the depths of the Styx a long time ago, alongside her lover.",
That's truly regrettable.,
"Ah, but she left behind a lyre, claiming that anyone who can play it would inherit all her musical genius.",
"Is that so? Your words give me hope, Hades. Please, take me to see that lyre.",
"Of course, no problem. But you must promise me that if you can play it, you will complete Orpheus's unfinished masterpiece.",
I will do everything in my power to play the breathtaking melody she could not finish!,
"Very well, I'm looking forward to hearing that lyre make music once again.",
"Beware, though; this divine lyre may take on your form to challenge you, to showcase your talent and recognize your presence!",
I will prove that my talent is worthy of it!,
"I've done it, Hades! I've gained the lyre's recognition!",
"I see it, Apollo. Congratulations. Since Orpheus, I haven't heard such a marvelous tune.",
"Of course, I don't expect you to stay, as you still have a sun to guide.",
I only hope you can stay a few more days so I can truly savor this extraordinary composition.,
"I am delighted to share this moment with you, Hades.",
I am not certain that I can play such a beautiful melody,
"Yeah, it would be a disservice to the instrument if talent does not match.",

"Goodness, am I in a time-travel or a movie set? Why are there suddenly so many... monsters on the streets?!",
"A human with golden hair, red eyes, and a sacred seal in the eyes... the Chosen One of the Seventh Divine Realm, I presume. I didn't expect to find you so quickly.",
"Chosen One of the Seventh Divine Realm? What are you talking about? Wait, you're not going to...",
"Lower your weapon, Freya! The girl in front of us is not the enemy you prophesied!",
"I apologize, Athena, the goddess of wisdom from Greece. For the future of the gods, I must end the fate of this human!",
"Athena, your rash actions are leading to a great mistake! You have no idea what terrible disasters she might cause in the future!",
You are the one making hasty decisions! I won't allow you to take the life of any innocent on such grounds!,
"Even if you stop me, it won't change anything. Without your protection, this girl will only fall into the clutches of the monsters!",
"You underestimate humanity. Her potential is enough to summon powerful angels. Quick, let the descending ritual begin!",
"Huh? Wait, are you talking about me? But I haven't even prayed for once...",
"Fear not. Concentrate your mind, seek help from the gods, and they will respond to your will!",
"Greetings, Athena. Is this girl my summoner?",
She... is the goddess who descended in response to my recent summoning?!,
"Yes, Gabriel is one of the most reliable among the many angels. She will protect you and safely guide you out of this city.",
"This is bad. The Chosen One's powers have awakened. I must stop her from leaving, or the gods will face another cycle of destruction!",
"Not happening! Freya, passing through me won't be so easy! Gabriel, go, take them away!",
"Unfortunately, I'm not alone here! Heimdall, the guardian of Asgard, intercept them. Don't let them leave the city!",
Looks like we'll have to defeat the guardian to get out. Time is of the essence. Let me teach you how to deploy your forces!,
Uh... is this the gap between the power of goddesses and mortals? It's a miracle I haven't been completely overwhelmed.,
"Heimdall, you didn't even give it your all.",
"Hmph... I just encountered monsters earlier and got injured, so I couldn't go all out.",
Stop pretending. Your fighting spirit is quite negative. It's clear you don't agree with Freya's ideals.,
"So many words. If you want to leave, it's better to do it now. Otherwise, I can't guarantee that you'll be able to after I recover.",
"What a conflicted individual... Anyway, no matter what, I'll remember this favor.",
"Gabriel, we've run through several streets. Why haven't we seen the city exit? Where is Lady Athena?",
"She's probably engaged in a fierce battle with Freya, buying us time. We better hurry before the monsters see us as snacks.",
The number of monsters on the road is increasing. It's not wise to confront them all. If only someone could come to our aid.,
"You are right. We need more help. Come, I'll instruct you on how to summon multiple angels at once!",

Staff of Apocalypse,
"In the prophecy of the apocalypse, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse will bring destruction to the world. This silver staff serves as the beacon guiding the end times.

Passionate Night - Uriel,
ACTIVITY_SUMMON_DESC_116,Care to guess how long you can endure in this prison of desire tonight?
Who summons me... Uriel? What intentions drive you to summon me to this abyss of iniquity?,
"The Apocalypse is imminent, and I need your help to persuade my sisters to stand together in this trying time.",
"The Apocalypse? I'm not well-versed in your Hebrew prophecies, but it sounds serious.",
"If the Apocalypse descends, the entire world will plunge into Armageddon!",
"Well, if it concerns the entire world, I can assist you. But before that, I need to test you.",
"You've passed my test. Now, tell me your plan, and let me prepare accordingly.",
"Thank you, Pandora. Some of my sisters are still in conflict with each other, and I must convince them to reunite.",
"You mean Michael and Lucifer? Hmm, I understand. Convincing them won't be easy; first, we need to find some allies.",
"Lucifer is a formidable adversary, but not without weaknesses; for instance, Loki can handle her.",
How can we find Loki then?,
"She is currently imprisoned on Yggdrasil, and we need to break through the defenses of the Valkyries.",
Who dares to intrude upon this Nordic sacred land?,
"My apologies, we're only here to borrow someone. She is crucial to us and to the fate of this world!",
You wish to rescue Loki? Then you must first pass through my challenge!,
"Damn! If you're taking her, you better have a valid reason!",
"The Apocalypse from the Hebrew legends is imminent, and we need Loki to persuade my people to unite.",
"Loki is a flake, so I need to accompany you to ensure she won't betray everyone.",
"Ah, I knew someone would come to set me free.",
This isn't about pardoning your crimes; we need your assistance.,
I never said I'd help you unless you can entertain me. I've been stuck here for ages; my muscles are getting stiff.,
"Our time is running out, Loki. We can't afford to dawdle any longer.",
"That's your time, not ours.",
"No worries, Uriel, let's just have some fun with her.",
"You always get me, Valkyrie.",
"Stop! Enough, you're hurting me!",
"Had enough fun now, Loki?",
"Had my fill. Hehe. So, what do you guys want?",
I need your help dealing with Lucifer.,
"Oh, the fallen archangel. Sure, I can handle her. Happens we have a bit of history. Lead the way then.",
"Pandora, we still need an ally to deal with Michael. She's a stubborn one, hard to persuade.",
"Athena excels at manipulating others' thoughts, especially effective against those with strong convictions. Let's seek her help.",
"Foreign goddesses, please stop. Olympus is currently not accepting guests.",
"I am no foreign deity; I am Pandora, the goddess of mystery and curiosity. Please let us pass, Icarus.",
But those behind you are.,
"Then, how can we convince you to let us in?",
Unless you can demonstrate power convincing enough.,
Are you testing my determination? Very well then.,
I believe I've proven myself.,
"Indeed, you've shown your strength. The gates of Olympus are open; please enter.",
Are you here to see Athena? She's currently discussing tactics with Ares. I advise against disturbing her.,
"The apocalypse is upon us, and I need Athena's assistance to withstand this catastrophe together.",
"Apocalypse? Sorry, I haven't heard of any impending apocalypse recently.",
I've heard the call of the Apocalypse; the Four Horsemen from the Hebrew prophecy are about to descend. Only unity can hope to overcome this crisis!,
"But I fail to see how that concerns Athena. Well, if you're in a hurry to go through, then battle me!",
"Alright, I concede. You may proceed.",
"Thank you, Gemini. If you don't mind, I would appreciate your help in saving this world.",
"Really? Well, now I'm interested.",
Who dares to intrude upon my War Council?,
"Noble goddess of wisdom, Athena, I seek your assistance.",
"Speak, what do you want me to help you with?",
"The Apocalypse is imminent, and my sisters are still in conflict. Only you can persuade them to unite and face it together.",
"You want me to mediate between Michael and Lucifer? Fine, but you must convince me with strength.",
"Now, do you agree to help?",
I will join your cause and stand with you to confront the Apocalypse in Hebrew.,
"Cupid, what are you doing here?",
"Just strolling around, you know, because I'm an angel too.",
Have you seen Lucifer and Michael?,
"Of course, you're looking for them? Beat me in a fight, and I'll tell you.",
"I'm up for the challenge, Cupid.",
"Now, you can tell us their whereabouts.",
"Well, okay, let me guide you.",
Lucifer!,
"Oh, my dear sister, the fallen one, Uriel.",
"You and Michael must cease your endless strife. The Apocalypse is upon us, and only through unity do we stand a chance!",
The Apocalypse is just a lie from the Creator. I'm more interested in understanding the feud between Michael and me.,
"Speaking of lies, that's my specialty. Let me reveal the truth for you!",
"Alright, you've won this round, but convincing me isn't enough. You need to make Michael stop.",
Understood. I'll persuade Michael to put aside her grievances with you.,
"Michael, please set aside personal grievances for now and join forces against the impending apocalypse!",
"It seems you've convinced Lucifer. Good. The feud started with her, and if she can let it go, so can I.",
"However, she just added a new debt to the old ones. If I can reclaim it, we can call it even.",
"If you seek repayment from her and create new conflicts, how can your grievances ever end?",
"Trust me, I've been where you are, in endless battles with my sister Ares, but eventually, we found peace.",
"Well, if you're determined to persuade me, then come and fight me!",
"I see your determination in your strength, Uriel. I will honor our agreement and temporarily reconcile with Lucifer.",
"If we're to face the Apocalypse, there's one more matter to settle. Whether or not it needs settling depends on you.",
Is there a difference?,
"There's a fearsome deity lingering in Hebrew. If you can gain her power, it might be helpful in the upcoming apocalypse.",
I will attempt to communicate with her and gain her power.,
"I'll take you to her, but be cautious; her emotions are quite unstable.",
"She lingers in this place, and anyone who sees her true form falls into fear.",
"I've been in Hell for millennia, I can face fear, let me try to soothe her.",
Who disturbs my slumber?,
"I am Uriel, the Angel of Hell, seeking your power.",
You seek my power too? Then let's see if your body can withstand this fear!,
"I have endured this fear, now please, bestow your power upon me. I will use it to prevent the Apocalypse.",
"Fear is like a plague, uncontrollably spreading. Handle it with care.",
I understand. I promise to use it for the right purpose.,
"What we need is unity, not the power of others.",
"You're right; we don't need overwhelming power. With unity, we can survive the Apocalypse.",
Don't you think quietly appreciating a dancer's graceful feet is a unique pleasure?,
,
"Ever since the day we crossed paths, I've been itching to be by your side...",
How do you view the rulers of the divine realm and the underworld?,
"I don't wish for the gods to impose eternal imprisonment on sinners. After all, there's hardly a sin that cannot be forgiven...",
"As a hybrid of god and demon, do you think I resemble an angel... or a demon more?",
Quite so.,
,
I like you for being so pure.,
Dancers also need to protect themselves.,
I hope for that too.,
I don't want to be a burden to you.,
There's not much difference between the two...,
At least the gods have principles.,
It's rare to hear you think this way.,
I don't think so.,
You look quite demonic.,
You're still an Angel at heart.,
,
Really? Then tell me... where is your gaze settling on me now?,
"I like this version of myself too. After all, power and authority ultimately fade with time.",
"I believe that when faced with danger, you will protect me, won't you?",
"Then maybe I should slow down, in both battles and in our life, so you can keep up with my pace.",
"If this 'burden' can bring me happiness, then it's not a bad thing, don't you think?",
Hmm... I agree. What the gods do is essentially just satisfying their own desires.,
"However, I've encountered many demons, and they are also very honorable. At least, they won't treat me differently because of my identity.",
"Hmm... because compared to the pain of eternal imprisonment, death might be a kind of release",
"Perhaps, but those sentenced to eternal imprisonment are not easy to deal with...",
"Ah, I see. It seems I need to prove that notion to you tonight..",
"Is that so? Well, maybe after spending a night with me tonight, you might change your mind.",

"She departed Asgard in ancient times, ascending as the ruler of the underworld. Yet, unlike other grim reapers, she willingly engages with the living.\nIn heaven, she has even established her own enchanted tower, where occasional seekers are welcomed to explore the secrets of life and death under her guidance.",
"In the name of the Lord of the Dead, I am willing to reach your soul, to forge an eternal pact, to cross the curtains of life and death, and to reach the distant shore on the other side...",
Death Tome,
"If the end of life could be foreseen, what choices would people make when confronted with the inevitability of departure?",
Are you afraid of death?,
Is it true that the Norse god of death was once perceived as a dark and fearsome figure in the hearts of humans?,
"No offense, but is it true that mortal conflicts have now been waged within these devices called cell phones?",
I have a fondness for opera. It's a small stage that encapsulates the vastness of history.,
"At times, I ponder why, if life demands the eternal cycle of birth and death, one is not bestowed immortality from the very inception?",
"Are you here to seek knowledge? My study holds the wisdom of countless scholars throughout the ages, spanning hundreds of years.",
"Yes, of course. After all, who doesn't want to live their life to the fullest?",
No. All things tangible must die eventually.,
That's not the case.,
Perhaps so.,
"Times have changed, ma'am.",
At least there is no need to worry about safety.,
I like it too!,
I'm not a fan of it...,
Perhaps the soul requires reincarnation for cleansing.,
Perhaps it is an oversight on the part of the Creator.,
"Yes, I presume wisdom.",
Um... I'd rather go to a pub.,
"Nevertheless, that's how the world works. It is inconceivable for anyone to endure an everlasting existence in this world.",
"Ha... Individuals like you, who possess such wisdom, have become a rare sight in this age that has long surpassed the reign of gods...",
Is that so? I've always been concerned that I appear overly serious.,
"Do young people these days truly have a preference for that sort of cool, unapproachable image resembling the god of death?",
"Can one really attain glory in such a manner? If one were to perish to battle within this realm, would their soul still be granted entry into the Valhalla?",
"Oh, it's quite amusing how humans are naturally inclined towards a bit of fighting. If indulging their craving for conquest can be satisfied through such a method, it might not be a bad thing.",
Depicting a story in the form of music is truly a magical and beautiful way of storytelling.,
"I can comprehend your viewpoint. After all, for many individuals, this form of performance is considered outdated.",
You are correct. The experiences of a hundred years can leave the soul weary beyond measure. Perhaps reincarnation can cleanse the pain within their hearts.,
The Creator wouldn't commit such a blunder. She has designed it this way for a purpose.,
"Very few humans are willing to spend centuries seeking the truth, but you, on the other hand, are quite an exception...",
"Well, looks like you don't need to leave after all. Because, after the sun sets, this place becomes more enchanting than any ordinary pub you can find...",
Oh no... I appear to have lost Der Ring des Nibelungen... I promised to lend it to Valkyrie!,
"Looks like someone's in a bit of a pickle. I am Pandora, the god of knowledge and mystery. May I assist you with anything?",
"Pandora? Ah, your name does sound familiar from the stories. They've mentioned that you have a penchant for helping people out of their trouble.",
That's right! It only takes a small price... just a tiny one...,
My cherished Der Ring des Nibelungen has gone missing. Could you help me find it?,
"Ah, certainly, I'd be delighted to help, ma'am. But it will take some time as I need to divine its location.",
It appears that your lovely little study has been visited by an uninvited guest. Someone has taken your book as a surprise.,
"Who would dare to do such a thing? Pandora, please help me to retrieve my books!",
"No need to hurry. As per my custom, I must first test your abilities. The rules are very simple: spar with me to win my approval.",
I believe I have passed your test.,
"Indeed, you are a powerful Angel. Now, let us embark on your quest to find that book thief!",
Hela? What brings you to Asgard instead of guarding the Helheim?,
"I have lost a book of mine, and Pandora divined its last known location to be in Asgard, so I come here to search for it.",
"I haven't seen your book... but coincidentally, I'm a bit bored. If you are up for a fight, I'll help you look for it.",
"Well, if you want to.",
"What an exhilarating battle! Alright, now it's time to fulfill our pact.",
"I believe with your assistance, the book thief will have nowhere to hide.",
"Freyja, my dear sister, it has been a long time since we last met.",
Hela? What are you doing here?,
"I've lost Der Ring des Nibelungen, the book which I had promised to lend to Valkyrie.",
"No, you should return to your position immediately, or else the Helheim will fall into chaos!",
"I must retrieve the book first. You may not be aware, that if the book ends up in the wrong hands, it could lead to even greater catastrophe!",
"Then I have to persuade you with force, my sister.",
"Der Ring des Nibelungen holds the secret of Valkyries to guide the Einherjars. If it falls into the wrong hands, the Valhalla will suffer immense damage!",
Maybe you re right! I'll join you in search for its location.,
"The Greek Goddess? What are they doing here? What's going on, Pandora?",
"That is Chaos, the Angel of chaos and darkness. We have reason to suspect that she's here for dirty secrets.",
"Pandora, you've made your way to Asgard as well. I heard that Loki is planning a big surprise for everyone, I presume you're here for that too?",
What do you mean by big surprise?,
"Ah, it seems you are not aware of it. But there is no need for you to know, as I am about to send you into the eternal darkness!",
"Darkness? Hah... Unfortunately, I'm quite familiar with it.",
It appears your mastery of darkness pales in comparison to mine.,
"Alright then, I will tag along and see how you handle the challenges next.",
"Angels, have you all been invited by Loki to appreciate her so-called gift?",
"No, Sun Goddess. I'm merely here to retrieve something that I have lost. But why are your Greek Goddesses flocking to the Norse land?",
"Loki claims to possess a relic that can summon the Einherjar, the great army of the dead. If it truly exists, we cannot let her have it!",
I believe you're referring to Der Ring des Nibelungen...,
"I regret to inform you that until I resolve this matter, you are not allowed to proceed any longer. Otherwise, I won't hesitate to take action!",
"I sense that she is no longer receptive to my explanations, so let us awaken her from her ignorance.",
"Since you insist on going, then let me accompany you to ensure the relic does not fall into the wrong hands.",
"Well, I can't stop you, can I? You're certainly persistent.",
"Ares, the Goddess of War. I've heard that you're fascinated by all sorts of powers, and it seems this time is no different.",
"If the method of summoning Einherjars can be found, then I can form an unbeatable legion!",
You're overestimating it! It's not as formidable as you imagine. I suspect Loki has tricked you all.,
"In any case, it worth a glimpse, isn't it? Perhaps there will be some unexpected rewards?",
"Well then, I'll have to thoroughly test whether you truly possess the qualifications.",
"You truly live up to the title of the Goddess of War. Even against us, you can only be subdued by sheer numbers.",
"No matter what you've said, I have lost. But I am still eager to see the so-called relic. Let me follow you and be a witness!",
"Sif, are you also intrigued by Der Ring des Nibelungen?",
I have no choice. Loki promised to gift me with lovely hair if I helped her stop you all.,
"After all these years, she still resorts to using that against you, huh?",
I can only put up with her games.,
"Well, then let's have some fun.",
"Such a pity. After this battle, you'll have to maintain your hair again.",
"It's OK, I'll just snatch it back from Thor anyway.",
I never expected that the great Ordin would become an accomplice to the thief.,
How do you know that the current me isn't Loki's illusion?,
Loki can't replicate... your foolishness.,
"Hahaha, Hela, you know me the best. Even though we haven't seen each other in so many years.",
"But Der Ring des Nibelungen, I demand it!",
"Sorry, but Valkyrie has already booked it. If you want it, prove yourself!",
"It seems that after all these years, you've improved quite a bit. Well, I suppose I've lost this time.",
You're smart enough to know when to back down.,
"Loki, your little game is over now. It's time to give back what you took from me.",
"Don't be in such a hurry, the real show hasn't even begun yet. Just wait until I have guided all the dead from Helheim to Valhalla...",
"Enough with the jokes, it's not amusing anymore.",
"You're still so boring. But it's okay, you'll soon come to accept it.",
"I don't think so, Loki.",
"Huh, you're still as dull as ever with no sense of humor. Fine, I will give you back the stupid book.",
"I'm glad you're coming to your senses. Alright, give it to me, I have other things to do.",
"I have a piece of news which can be given to you for free: your book's missing a page. Complete it, and you'll gain even greater power.",
"Sounds fascinating, let's fill it in then.",
"I knew you would have said yes! Now let's find out who has the last page!Valkyrie, I knew it was you!",
"Valkyrie, I knew it was you!",
"It looks like you have discovered my secret. All I needed was to obtain Der Ring des Nibelungen, absorb the power of the deceased, and ascend.",
"Unfortunately, Loki's meddling has disrupted my plan.",
"So, borrowing it from me was just a long-planned scheme?",
"Exactly. Now that you know everything, the only way to retrieve your book is to defeat me.",
"It looks like you are far more formidable than I've imagined. Here, is the last page of that book.",
You've made a wise choice. The fate of the deceased can only be controlled by Death.,
I have no interest in power. All I want to do now is to go home and take a bath.,

strengthen_q_1,Q1: Which angels should I prioritize development?
strengthen_q_cont_1,"SSR+ Angels > SSR Angels> SR+ Angels> SR Angels> R+ Angels> R Angels> N Angels\nPrioritize training higher-quality angels. You can confidently train the angels you obtain early on. If you later acquire higher-quality angels, you can transfer the training progress from previously trained angels to the new ones.\nNote: The MC cannot undergo inheritance."
strengthen_q_2,Q2: How can I quickly level up?
strengthen_q_cont_2,"Leveling up requires a significant amount of [Player EXP]. The battlefield is the only source of [Player EXP]. When battlefield stages become too challenging due to CR limits, you can use Quick Battle and Idle Rewards to gain [Player EXP]. The higher the stage you reach, the more [Player EXP] you can earn from idling."
strengthen_q_3,Q3: How can I quickly obtain development resources?
strengthen_q_cont_3,"Quick Battle allows you to obtain basic development resources. For detailed information on how to acquire various development resources, refer to the Power-Up Guide feature. It provides comprehensive details on the sources of various angels training resources!"
strengthen_q_4,Q4: How can I create the most effective team combinations?
strengthen_q_cont_4,"You can refer to the Power-Up Guide feature, specifically the Beginners Tips and Angel Recommendations sections. These sections provide various team combinations, ensuring that you can find a lineup suitable for your currently trained angels."
strengthen_q_5,Q5: What gear should I choose and how to deal with them?
strengthen_q_cont_5,
strengthen_q_6,"Q6: How can I increase an angel's favorability, and what are the benefits?"
strengthen_q_cont_6,"You can increase an angel's favorability by sending her on <color=#FFF4AA>[Adventures]</color> and giving her [Gifts], which can be obtained from gift boxes found during <color=#FFF4AA>[Adventures]</color>. Increasing an angel's favorability grants attribute boosts. When the affection level is high enough, you can use a [Magic Star Ring] to form a vow with the angel, providing significant bonuses."

"Pandora, I call upon you. Break my chains and restore my freedom...",
"Oh my, Prometheus, the thief of heavenly fire, the last Titan. So, have you finally decided to break Zeus's bonds?",
I feel Zeus's hold on me weakening. Perhaps it is time to escape this eternal prison.,
"Oh, of course, of course. But before that, I must test you. If you pass, I'll set you free.",
"Very well, I've endured many trials before. One more won't hurt.",
It seems I've passed your so-called trial.,
"I underestimated you. Even bound by Zeus's chains, your power is formidable.",
"So, what will you do next? Confront Zeus and settle old scores?",
"Yes, but first, I need to find two allies. Will you help as well? Once it's done, I'll reward you handsomely.",
"It's a deal, my future Titan queen.",
"Do you remember me, Gemini?",
Prometheus! You... how?,
,
I have a new divine role now and can't help you take down Zeus... But if I were to accidentally become your captive...,
"Heh, are you suggesting I defeat you first? Alright then, if that's what you want.",
You've lost a lot of strength. It seems millennia of imprisonment have weakened you. Zeus... that cowardly tyrant!,
I have no regrets about my past decisions. I just want to seek justice from Zeus.,
"My dear Cupid, we meet again.",
,
,
,
,
,
"Heh, you know me well.",
,
,
"Even though you've found two powerful allies, you're still too weak to face Zeus. How about I take you to gather some strength first?",
It looks like our charger is already here waiting for us.,
Who are you calling a charger?,
"This girl is brimming with lightning power. If I absorb her static electricity, I can regain half of my former strength.",
,
,
,
Your electricity has restored a significant amount of my energy.,
,
,
"I remember you. When Zeus imprisoned me, you were just a little girl. What should I call you now? Ares, the God of War, protector of Greece?",
"So, the ghost of the past has broken free from its cage, returning from the underworld for vengeance?",
,
,
Perfect. I can absorb your energy to restore my divine power.,
You! Why does my power not only fail to harm you but instead gets absorbed and used against me?,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"Ah, my power is being drained by you!",
,
"Ah, the Pantheon. How many centuries have I been away from here?",
,
"It seems Zeus's will has weakened, loosening his control over me. That allowed me to summon Pandora.",
,
"From what I know, Prometheus is no threat. In fact, she is even more beloved by mortals than Zeus.",
,
,
No matter. There are more powerful goddesses ahead waiting for you!,
,
"Long time no see, Hades. You were part of the plan that put me in that cage.",
"So, are you here for revenge?",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Why?,
,
,
"I accept your proposal, Zeus.",
,
"I reject your proposal, Zeus.",
"Very well, I sort of expected that... you're free to leave now.",
,
,
"Since you refuse to wield the power of revenge, let me take your place and become the new Prometheus!",
This power has taken on a physical form!,
"It seems this power has been tainted by your resentment, becoming a vengeful manifestation. You must deal with her!",
"It seems this power has been tainted by your resentment, becoming a vengeful manifestation. You must deal with her!",
,
"Alright, let's see who truly deserves to be called Prometheus.",
"Fortunately, impostors can never become real.",
Please don't misunderstand. I didn't escape from the cage for revenge. I wanted to witness the joy people experience after gaining fire.,
Frenzied Nocturne - Horus,
ACTIVITY_SUMMON_DESC_140,Would you be interested in dancing with me tonight until dawn?
Divine Covenant - Zeus,
ACTIVITY_SUMMON_DESC_141,Are you more captivated by my supreme power or the beauty beneath my elegant attire?
"You unlocked the prison where the gods had confined me, yet I willingly placed the chains of bondage upon myself for you. Fate truly is an inexplicable force...",
"Prometheus was the last Titan. She forged chains from flames and, alongside Zeus, sealed the fate of her kin. However, just as she believed Zeus would become the enlightened ruler of a new era, she betrayed her, swallowing the seeds of victory to create a world ruled by the gods.\nIn her fury, Prometheus turned away and used herself as kindling to ignite a fire, casting it to the earth. From this sacrificial blaze, new sparks blossomed across the land.",

Prometheus (Fake),
Hades,
Humans always think Titan means everything is big. What do you think about that?,
I totally agree!,
"Interesting answer... My next question is, where were your eyes focused when you answered me just now?",
"Clearly, Titan doesn't mean that.",
"Well, it seems you're more conservative than I thought, haha...",
"Truth is like a beacon in the wind, only through self-sacrifice can it be preserved.",
"Indeed, truth cannot be extinguished.",
"As you say, however, I have witnessed too many attempts to suppress truth, both in the past and present.",
"Yet, this implies sacrifice.",
"Exactly, even if we fall in pursuit of truth, there will be others who follow in our footsteps.",
"Reason and emotion, the eternal loop of creation, the perpetual speculation...",
What if there were no emotions?,
"Well, people would turn into lifeless machines, and this place would become a dull, lifeless world.",
And what if there were no reason?,
"Heh, then we'd probably be just a few days away from the next brawl in the divine realm!",
"During my days of imprisonment by Zeus, I was quite bored, so bored that I ended up naming every star in the sky.",
Would you like to tell me about it?,
"If you have the time, I'd be delighted to invite you to my room and spend the whole night slowly telling you their names...",
Every single star?,
"Yep, but for mortals, it's probably best not to do the same, or before you know it, you'll likely need glasses!",
I enjoy attending parties with Hephaestus because she always manages to find common ground with me.,
What does she like to talk about?,
"She often discusses how instead of focusing on making flames brighter, we should think about how to warm people's hearts...",
What do you like to talk about?,
"I always ask her if she has any ideas that can make someone's heart race, and then I let her guess who I'm planning to use it on.",
"So, Zeus has started decorating her palace with candles and torches now? I remember when the Primordial Flame was born, she was afraid of burning down the divine realm.",
"As a king of the gods, one should be a bit more cautious.",
Forget it! I bet now she looks forward to a wild fireworks show every night.,
"That's overly cautious, isn't it?",
"Absolutely, she was so worried about fire being too dangerous back then, she ended up eating cold bread for half a year...",

"Alright, watch me!",

,
"The piece of the Creator's Key you hold was once mine. As long as I sense it, I can teleport to its location.",
"So, it can really do what Pandora claimed, find and unlock the Outer Realm?",
,
,
,
Ambitious fools wanting to find the key to the Outer Realm? How delusional!,
,
,
,
,
None of you are getting away from here!,
,
Only a strong body can harness greater power. Spinning rapidly through the wind tunnel is clearly a form of training.,
,
,
,
I see the fragment of the Creator's Key! But that guardian looks formidable.,
That fragment has granted the guardian tremendous power. Proceed with caution!,
,
,
"We must defeat her and obtain the third fragment, as only the power of the fragments can help us open the door to the Outer Realm!",
,
"I expected the Outer Realm to be a land of untold treasures, but all I see are ancient ruins.",
"Yet, the value hidden within these ancient ruins far exceeds your imagination, as long as you restore and manage the Outer Realm properly.",
,
"Really? That sounds quite exciting! There must be even more treasures waiting, right?",
,
,
,
,
I presume only one of us can enter this world.,
,
"It seems she wants you to make a choice, Chosen One.",
,
,
"I sense the energy of another fragment of the Creator's Key. With a bit of luck, we might soon have the next piece.",
,
Are you questioning my taste? Turning these otherworldly products into edible food was no small feat on my part.,
,
,
,
Ah ha!,
,
,
"Did you know, this item can also serve as the key to the Seventh Illusion Realm? Collecting all the Creator's Key fragments will grant access to the Seventh Illusion Realm!",

,
,
Off? What do you mean?,
,
,
,
,
,
,

"So, should we turn back and find another route? Or maybe you could use your tarot cards to find a solution?",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"Unfortunately, our only option may be to defeat these illusions.",
"Lucky us. Honestly, I never expected to safely leave that frost-covered world through the portal.",
,
,
This world may not even belong to the same dimensional plane.,
"Yes, due to temporal distortions, the two worlds have merged, creating this chaotic landscape.",
,
"But that also means there could be more opportunities and treasures, right?",
,
,
,
"Sorry, should I step aside so you two can settle your personal grievances?",
,
,
,
,
What do you mean?,
,
The guardian of this world must be a deity of order.,
,
,
The Chosen One and Pandora? I expected you would eventually end up here.,

The power of nature is always worthy of trust and reliance.,
I miss the peaceful afternoon tea time every day before the end of the world.,
"Time is the best medicine to heal the earth, and the scars of war will eventually disappear with the dust.",
Are you interested in signing a new contract with the cute and charming succubus idol?,
Um? I seemed to feel a burning gaze wandering over me...,
"There is no need for the earth to avoid the hardships of fate, because only by experiencing hardships can it become more solid.",
It is quite a pleasure to watch human beings struggle with their inevitable fate.,
"Dancing on the battlefield is not only an art form, but also a declaration of victory.",
"Youth is a priceless treasure. Whether it is appearance, vitality or passion, they are meaningful only when accompanied by youth!",
"I will always gallop fearlessly on the battlefield, and every time I swing my weapon, I will fight for glory and justice!",
"Go find a belief worth holding on to. No matter you face confusion or fear, I will always bless you.",

"I thought about facing the end of this world alone, until you showed me a glimmer of hope...",
"The reason why God is called God is not because of his great power, but because of his extraordinary courage and determination to die!",

"The only difference between love and war is...there are never winners in war, but there are never losers in love.",
"In my opinion, war is just a pastime between the strong!",
"Don't worry, dear, we still have plenty of time tonight...",
Capture people's hearts with charm and drive away darkness with strength.,
"There are not many mortals who dare to look me in the eye, but none of them are strangers to the light.",
Spring is the happiest season of the year because there is nothing more beautiful than the cherry blossoms scattering in the spring breeze.,
Ah! It's another sunny day. Take me for a walk. Maybe I can dig some carrots on the way.,
"Looking into the distance, at the end that is beyond the reach of the eyes, may be the place where fate cannot control.",
The pain brought by thorns is also an unforgettable enjoyment...,
"When facing a battlefield, the weak always have reasons to escape, while the strong have no fear at all!",
Do you like my dancing? Maybe I can do a little... more daring dance just for you.,
Huh...it's time to rain again! How about I make a few loud thunders to liven up the atmosphere?,

"The gate of the Seventh Divine Realm, a sanctuary buried in truth, finally welcoming me with open doors.",
"Icarus, halt your steps! The truth you seek will only lead to your destruction. Its searing blaze will melt your wings, casting you back into the abyss.",
,
"The truth you chase is not worth another sacrifice. True knowledge does not mean perishing in its pursuit, but rather finding life in its revelation.",
,
Because I can see further. Your spirit cannot bear the weight of the truth.,
Then let me prove to you that truth is worth any cost.,
,
I have been prepared for a long time.,
,
,
"Perhaps so. I once saw your life as a fleeting spark, but it seems I was mistaken.",
"I hope you will accompany me, to witness the moment when my soul stands before the truth.",
,
,
And yet I regret it. The price of flame is beyond what mortals can bear. Truth only leads them down a path of destruction.,
,
,
Your craving for truth is merely an impulsive reach into the unknown. Have you ever considered whether humanity can truly withstand its blazing light?,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"Then let me be the one to restore that order! If you doubt my strength, allow me to prove my worth through battle.",
,
"You indeed have the strength to pursue truth, but strength alone is not enough. Only restraint brings true salvation.",
,
"Icarus, do you truly understand what lies ahead? Your determination is admirable, but no god will let you pass so easily.",
,
"Conviction is only the beginning. True truth demands courage, compassion, and wisdom to wield it. The Creator has set these trials for you, and I am one of them.",
,
,
,
,
,
"I understand your doubts, Lady Amaterasu. Many who have sought to wield truth with pride have ultimately been lost to the power it brings.",
,
"I do. Compassion means setting aside selfish desires and aligning with the fate of all things. If I cannot prove this, then I am unworthy of approaching the truth.",
"Then let me witness your resolve. If you can remain uncorrupted by this power in battle, I shall acknowledge your determination.",
,
"As you said, I will hold compassion at my core and illuminate the path ahead for both humanity and the gods.",
,
,
,
"You speak well, but to me, these are just words. Many gods once believed themselves wise, only to become slaves to desire and meet their end.",
"As you said, true wisdom should guide justice and hope, not be lost in the allure of power.",

"Wisdom should serve to establish order, not personal desire. Without this clarity, truth would be meaningless to me.",

"This is the entrance to the Seventh Divine Realm. Even though I have lost much of my divine power, the Creator has not abandoned me.",

,
I believe I now possess the strength to face them.,
,
,
"As part of the angelic order, I may not be a perfect arbiter on the battlefield, but I will undoubtedly be a steadfast protector.",
,
"As you say, it would be an honor.",
,
"Your tolerance and peace are too weak. You wish to redeem this world, yet you fail to understand that once a sin is committed, it cannot be erased.",
Those sinners do not deserve forgiveness. They must face punishment to ensure justice for all.,
"Your version of justice is nothing but punishment. It may instill fear, but it cannot heal the wounds of the world. Without mercy and redemption, the world will forever spiral in this cycle of decay.",
Your so-called redemption cannot make sinners repent. Only punishment can make them truly remember what is forbidden and what is just.,
"I understand your doubts, but this does not restore true order. If you believe violence is the only solution, then show me your weapon!",
,
,
,
,
,
"Raphael, your faith may be noble, but it is too broad. Not everyone is deserving of sympathy.",
"Protection is not indiscriminate charity. As an angel who once lost your powers, you lack the strength to save the entire world.",
,
,
"Though I may not fully agree with your ideals, I must admit, no one has ever broken through my defenses so effortlessly.",
,
,
"Archangel Raphael, the Creator has willed me to end your cycle of life and death.",
,
,
,
The wars among the gods have shattered the world. Death has already engulfed the land. I am confident I can end this chaos and bring salvation.,
"Interesting. If you are indeed the one capable of breaking this endless cycle of life and death, bringing miracles to this world, then you must prove yourself worthy by overcoming me!",
,
"Horus, the cycle of life and death is indeed a natural law. I do not intend to destroy it but to create a world without violence or strife.",
,
I will not falter.,
,
,
,
"Eliminating evil may temporarily banish darkness, but it cannot prevent its rebirth.",
"We must change the hearts of sinners; otherwise, we are merely removing weeds without planting new seeds. Peace will remain a hollow dream.",
,
,
,
,
"Savior of all creation, Archangel Raphael, the Warlord of Purgatory welcomes your arrival.",
,
"Asura, the strength born of destruction is fleeting. A world built on war is doomed to collapse.",
"You are too naive. Survival of the fittest is the law of nature, the foundation of true order. Your ideals only serve to stagnate the world.",
"Only through the forge of war and the rise of the victor can a new future be created. You lack the will to fight, clinging to fragile beliefs!",
,
Good. Show me how you can prevail in battle without the will to destroy!,
,
"I may not have your destructive might on the battlefield, but the Creator has answered my resolve to save the world. You cannot overcome me.",
,
True strength does not stem from destruction or domination but from protection and salvation. Victory without conflict is the ultimate power.,

"It bears the blessing of the Creator, and the light within the ring shines like the spark of wisdom, constantly reminding her: only through tolerance and redemption can we tear through the darkness and welcome the new dawn.",
"Do you believe that fate has destined us to walk a certain path, even if that path does not lead to the destination we desire?",
"When two people are fearless in giving for each other, it is no longer just a simple promise, but a contract of souls.",
"There is too much pain in the world, but every act of redemption injects new hope into it.",
"Even the most merciless have a softer side, and when they seek repentance, perhaps what we can offer is simply forgiveness.",
"I often imagine a world without war. Though it feels distant, belief will eventually bring this era to fruition.",

We are not bound by fate.,
Perhaps that is indeed the case.,
Promises are indeed important.,

"As you said, once a promise becomes a pact, it transcends time and space, becoming an eternal part of our lives.",
"A pact is the deepest form of promise. While it burdens us, it also gives us endless strength.",
"I believe that these little bits of power, like sunlight, though seemingly fragile, can melt even the hardest ice and snow.",
,
Forgiveness gives people the courage to face their own weaknesses. Only by accepting our weaknesses can we find the strength to rise again.,
,
"Faith guides us, telling us that no matter how far we go, we will eventually reach that ideal destination.",
"Doubt is human nature, but each step we take in persistence adds one more piece to the puzzle of the world we dream of.",
,
"Thank you. At least, your unwavering companionship is the most perfect thing for me.",
"If fate separates us, I will build a bridge of faith, crossing time and space, until we reunite. No matter how the world changes, my vow will never waver.",

Do you truly believe your conviction can carry you to the end? Do you think sheer determination is enough to overcome everything?,
,
,
,
"Wisdom is not a universal key. It can guide your way, but it cannot replace action and conviction. On this path, only determination and courage are the greatest powers.",
,
I will not stop until the moment death claims me.,
"Pause your steps, Heimdall. Your faith and determination are truly admirable. Not only did you triumph in the trial of wisdom, but you also displayed an unyielding spirit.",
,
,
"Fearing responsibility is a sign of weakness. I stand to protect unwavering beliefs, and on this path of conviction, I would rather perish than retreat even a single step.",
,
,
"You truly are an extraordinary soul. Though I believed the immense power of frost would shake your resolve, you pressed forward without hesitation.",
,
,
"Heimdall, the path ahead is not yours to take. If you insist on moving forward, it will only lead to your demise.",
,
,
,
,
"I care nothing for the dictates of fate, Freyja. To retreat now would bring shame upon my name as a guardian of the North.",
"Then let us make a pact. If you can defeat me, I will lend you my strength in your fight against Loki. But if you cannot, I ask that you turn back and leave the Seventh Divine Realm.",
So be it.,
,
Odin once told me that fate is not unchangeable. Perhaps this means I may yet overcome Loki in the final battle.,
"As I have promised, if you can best me, I will do all I can to shield you in the battles to come. And when the time comes to face Loki, I will stand by your side.",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"A shame, ruler of the dead, but I will not let death take away what I hold dear so easily.",
,
,
"I do not believe in fate, Hela. You may rule over the destinies of the dead, but my destiny is not yet yours to claim.",
"Your resolve is unshakable, that much is clear. But if you cannot break free from the shadow of death, you, too, will ultimately become a prisoner of fate.",
Then come! I would rather die on the battlefield than let fate crush my convictions.,
I cannot change your obsession with the power of Creation. But now I see how much what you protect truly means to you.,
,
"How intriguing. Very well, let me bear witness to this ending as well.",
,
,
"But I am no longer the reckless guardian I once was. To claim the power of Creation, I have changed. The divine flames of Asgard will burn anew in my hands.",
,
"But when I glimpsed the power of the Creator, I realized that stubbornly defending the gods brings no hope. The gods must move forward, even through the cycles of life and death.",
,
,
,
"Loki, you rely too much on this so-called fate you claim will lead to my defeat.",
,
"Even if you claim the power of Creation, centuries from now, Asgard will still fall to me. Ragnarok will come again.",
,
"Consider this your victory for now, Heimdall, but keep your eyes open. The rebellion of the Trickster God never ceases.",

"With boundless thunder and flames, I shall purify this apocalyptic battlefield.",
,
,
,
,
,
"But sometimes, unchecked strength devours everything in its path. Have you ever paused to consider the doubts of the Norse gods or the anguish that endless war brings them?",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"You do have a heart for protecting the Norse gods, Thor, but unlike you, I never stop examining my weaknesses.",
"Is that so? If this battle helps me see my weaknesses, then it will have been worthwhile!",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"Centuries ago, on the battlefield of Ragnarok, I already proved that I fear no death. Do you really think another test is necessary?",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"How amusing. Do you really think our feud is merely about grudges? You know as well as I do that during the battle of Ragnarok, I had no choice. I merely embraced the destiny that was mine to bear.",
,
"Fate has never been something you or I could alter. The Norse gods have always fought against it, yet they never realized our end was written long before.",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"I gave up myself, my comrades, and even Asgard itself for my oaths. And in the end? Ragnarok still came, and all was lost to silence.",
,
,
,
You still possess the courage you showed on that battlefield of doom. Perhaps you really are the one destined by the Creator.,
I hope this battle rekindles your fighting spirit and helps you rediscover the meaning of honor and conviction.,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Responsibility often brings solitude. It demands not only that you rise to great heights but also endure the deepest lows. Yet every All-Father before us has answered the call of responsibility in their own way.,
,
"You are no longer the young warrior who sought to solve everything with thunder and brute force, Thor.",
,
,
,
Then there is nothing more to say. May the glory of Asgard forever illuminate your path forward.,

"Cupid, this pursuit is far from boring. The power of creation determines the balance and future of the world. I cannot allow it to fall into dangerous hands.",
,
,
,
,
,
"Rationality and order have always guided my actions, and that is the very source of my strength.",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"Your conviction shows me another facet of hope. Your courage is undeniable, but perhaps that courage needs to be balanced with wisdom to truly bring forth light.",
"Wisdom may be important, but I still believe that even a moth flying into the flame can ignite light for the world.",
,
,
,
"Fire is a symbol of life, and its flames carry the power of renewal. What you call order is nothing but a manifestation of chains and fear.",
"Without responsibility and reason, that fire will devour all in its path. Granting humanity such power means imposing consequences they may not be ready to bear.",
"So, you think such power should remain in the hands of gods? You sit upon your lofty thrones while humanity struggles even to control their right to survive.",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
"By the name of the one who governs truth and light, I will never break my word.",
,
"As you say, for the sake of both gods and mortals, power is essential. But we both know power comes with responsibility.",
"And the most important responsibility of a ruler in the new world is to care for every life, ensuring equal opportunities and freedom, rather than wielding your thunder to control everything.",
Equality and freedom? Those are nothing but futile fantasies to me. The laws of the universe dictate that the strong rule over the weak. Only under the guidance of power can order be maintained.,
"I do not oppose the existence of strength, but I hope we can guide such power through wisdom and morality, not fear and oppression.",
,
,
"But now, you have a stronger resolve and allies willing to stand by your side. Perhaps it is time for me to entrust this power to you.",
"The true challenge lies not only in having unwavering belief but in maintaining and ruling with order. At the very least, I will not disappoint you in this task.",
,
,
,
,
,
"Do you truly believe that order can make all things thrive endlessly? It only provides temporary stability, not lastingness. True power still comes from chaos, for it is the eternal law of the universe.",
,
,
,
,
But it is precisely because chaos contains infinite possibilities that it must be guided by order. Only through the interaction of order and chaos can the world be sustained.,
"Perhaps, young Apollo, you have your beliefs, and I have my rules. In the end, time will prove everything.",
"Apollo, the master of truth and light, meeting you here is no surprise to me, but our battle has been destined.",
"As fellow sages of Olympus, before our fight begins, I would like to hear your reason for opposing me.",
,
"To me, wisdom should not be confined to material victory. True wisdom lies in leading both humans and gods to higher, brighter realms, helping them transcend the ordinary.",
"The rationality you insist on will only trap people in rigid constraints. True wisdom should be alive, a force to make the world stronger and more practical.",
,
,
Then let me see if the wisdom you follow can withstand my challenge.,

"But when one possesses unimaginable power, ambition becomes irrelevant. Whether one desires change or not, such power must be wielded to usher in a new order for the divine realm.",

"The power I seek from the Creator will ultimately be used to uphold the order of the Norse gods. As a sacred dragon sworn to protect, I assume your will is no different from mine.",
,
,
But have you considered that clinging too tightly to these rules might strip everything of meaning? And what if breaking them could lead to a better world?,
,
Yet the future I see is not set in stone. Every soul has a role to play in the grand mechanism of fate.,
,
,
"I have always seen my duty as my purpose. That duty granted me unwavering will and immense strength, yet it kept me from ever questioning my own true thoughts.",
"I was once like you, but now, I will reflect and seek answers. Perhaps the future of the Norse gods holds more possibilities than we have ever considered.",

"Final destination? It seems you remain unchanged, still believing that death is the inevitable end of all things.",

,
Nothing escapes the erosion of time. Even the near-eternal souls within Valhalla must one day face me when the world meets its end.,
,
,
,
"And I believe you are the one refusing to face reality, commander of the Valkyries.",

"The embodiment of death, you should not have stepped into this realm of ice and snow, a place that belongs solely to the Creator. You disturb this eternal paradise, frozen in the order of the universe.",

,
,
"But since you wish to prove that the end is a part of order, let me first see if you have the power to melt the eternal ice and snow I hold in my hands.",

This is simply the power to return order to its original state.,

"No need to search. Wisdom itself is the path to transcendence. I exist within the storm, witnessing the passage of eras. Mortal lives and deaths are just waves crashing in my eyes, and I shall never sink.",

,
,
,
"At least you are far wiser than those who still resist death. So, tell me, have you glimpsed a fragment of truth?",
,
An interesting answer. I look forward to discussing wisdom with you in the underworld when your life reaches its end.,
,
,
,
"Fate is not something you can resist. Just like death, it was decided the moment you were born. The outcome of every battle has already been determined.",
"And our confrontation, in the end, is just another link in the chain of fate, and your resistance is nothing but an inevitable process.",
,
,
,
,
,
,
"One day, you will truly realize where your path leads, and by then, victory will eventually favor you.",
"Is it a surprise to see me here, Hel? Your steps have truly been faster than all the goddesses of the North.",

"No matter how you distort the facts, death will not cooperate with your lies. It simply exists, as the most basic and truthful reality.",

"Even in the face of our combined strength, you still stand unyielding. It seems the Creator has already made His choice.",
,
"You were once one, yet you stand in opposition of thought. You are also independent gods, yet inseparable from one another. Perhaps your very existence is the answer itself.",
,
,
,
,
,
"Exactly because of that, fate is even more precious. Have you ever thought, if there were no bonds in this world, how lonely people would become?",
,
,
,
,
,
,
"Such things that endure are impervious to any force. I, the embodiment of fate and destiny, give you my word on that.",
,
,
"Fate is a mysterious force. Some live their lives in solitude, while others find a companion for life. Can you truly control it? Or are you simply an observer?",
Control? Not quite. I merely witness and guide it.,
"You have many questions, but perhaps the best answers are ones you should seek yourself.",
,
,
,
Exactly. Fate is both a guide and an unknown adventure.,
"Heh, perhaps this adventure will lead to even more interesting people and events.",
,
Were you waiting for me?,
,
,
,
,
"The meaning of fate has never been about its duration, but rather the bond it creates. Even as people and things change, emotions remain. Many are not forgotten, and no one is truly alone.",
,
,
,
,
,
As you said.,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
To understand the true meaning of fate.,
"Indeed, this is your mission. But aside from that, have you noticed that, in the grand scheme of things, you are also undergoing a trial?",
"You are the god who connects all things, while I am the great deity who rules over the eight million gods. If one day my light no longer shines upon the earth, who will inherit my duty to protect Japan and all the gods?",
,
"The way of the gods is not about authority; it is about connection. To rule over the gods is not through divine might alone, but through bonds of fate, ensuring that all living beings find their rightful place.",
,
,
"Sometimes, the fate that comes with destiny is not one you choose for yourself, but rather a will imposed upon you by the Creator. If you wish to prove that you truly understand the meaning of fate, then answer me with your battle!",
It seems your strength is already enough to bear this divine might.,
,
Is that your answer?,
"Yes, fate is not about power, but about bonds. Even gods should not treat it as a tool to control others, but as a bridge that connects them.",
,
,
Exactly. The fate of Japan and the entire pantheon will now be reshaped in your hands. May all things in this world return to the will of the Creator.,
I will not fail in my mission.,

"The life of a mortal is short, but he always loves to daydream... But perhaps that is what makes humans interesting.",
"How much do you think your soul is worth? Don't worry, I won't accept it casually. You have to at least make me interested.",
"I occasionally listen to music and go to bars... Times are changing so fast, there are a lot of new things every day.",
,
"Mortals always like to make wishes for the future, but do you know? The interesting thing about the future is that it shall defy your will, always.",
"Humans are really interesting. They live in various pacts every day, but they always feel that they are being cheated.",
Don't you dream?,
The dream might come true someday!,
I don't want to sell my soul!,
My soul is priceless!,
Fallen angels also follow the trend?,
So do you have any recommendations?,
,
I felt a sense of danger...,
What if my wish is outrageous enough?,
Maybe I should give up expecting...,
It is human nature to be cautious.,
At least I believe in your pact.,
"Of course, I occasionally dream about heaven and other angels... but that's usually the beginning of a nightmare.",
"You are so innocent and lovely - with this energy, maybe you can really make a miracle happen.",
"Humph, but unfortunately, in my world, souls only have a price, and there is no choice of whether to sell or not...",
What a confident answer. Perhaps your priceless soul is what I want most...,
"I don't want to be eliminated by human aesthetics - what's more, if I don't know how to enjoy it, it would be a waste of this eternal life.",
"As for music, how about some gothic rock? As for the wine...would you like to try my new invention, Fallen Angel Special?",

Hehe... smart choice. Most of the guys who wanted to be my master ended up becoming my pets...,
"Then you'd better ask me, the most dangerous guy in the world, if I agree, my dear.",
"Giving up expectations would be boring - after all, life is more exciting when it's full of drama, isn't it?",
"However, the most deadly deceptions often do not come from devils, but from humans... You are much more professional at cheating than I am.",
Of course - at least I will put the price on the table so that you will be willing to jump in.,

Creator's Glory,
"Is this the Creator's courtyard? It's not as luxurious and solemn as I imagined, but it doesn't disappoint me, hum...",
"Hey, isn't this the fallen angel? I thought you wouldn't be interested in the remains of the Creator.",
"I came here because this lousy place still holds some value, unlike you, sneering at everything, sat among the ruins like you've already won.",
"Oh, but I have won, darling. Countless times. At least I don't spend my days haunted by the shadow of Heaven's exile.",
You regard destruction as faith and deception as the meaning of survival. The chaos you sow is but a means of the weak. The power of the Creator shall never be yours.,
"You put your stamp on this ruin, and I will sing a dirge for it. Come on, fallen angel, let the battle between you and me be the climax of this farce.",
,
,
,
,
,
"You are finally here, Lucifer, the legendary Wings of the Fallen, are you ready to face the spokesperson of truth?",
"Athena, your wisdom once outshine mine, but I gained truth at the cost of corruption, while you cling to your hold light and justice, which makes me disappointed.",
,
But you forged it into shackles and dedicated it to those gods who are not worthy of guiding creation. Your order is nothing more than enslaving everyone to serve the gods.,
"Your so-called wisdom is just your excuse for dominating everything. Since neither yields, let's use this battle to prove our own ideas!",
"...Sure enough, your will is more stubborn than I expected...But I still don't agree with you...Lucifer...",
"Agree? What I want is not your approval, but your concession. Wisdom should not be a slave to light, and I am the only one who can break the lie.",
"...If the future order is as your wish, I hope it will be more fair than today's battle...Otherwise, you will eventually become the God you hate the most...",
"I will remember this warning, Athena, may you too remember this battle today: even the mightiest wisdom has been defeated by the fallen.",
,
"Ra, you regard light as a blessing and darkness as a sin. You think you are the mother of the gods who illuminates all, but you are just a remnant of an old order.",
"You are no longer the light and the morning star, but a guide who lures the weak to betray the Heaven. I will not let you ignite new disasters with your distorted order.",
"You are afraid the world will see another light and that they will no longer worship at your altar. This is not protection, but fear. I will not fear your flames.",
,
"You are indeed stronger than before...but what you bring is not hope, but arrogance and hubris...",
I don't need to bring the hope you speak of to others. I just want them to know that they can rebel the sun and kindle their own light.,
"There are too many wills that deviate from order in this world... If you become an unprincipled ruler, destruction will only come again.",
"Humph, don't worry so much, Sun God. If one day my rule also falls into chaos... then someone will naturally pull me down from the altar.",
"Ha... Lucifer, you are actually standing in the Creator's Paradise. It seems that you are no longer a fallen angel, but an invader who attempts to reshape the order of hell.",
Too late for such words. Your causality and punishment have long rotted in the ashes of purgatory.,
"You are right, I do not represent heaven, but just uphold the ancient covenants. Hell is not a chess game for you to re-establish your authority. It is not too late to admit defeat now.",
"You are afraid that I will recreate this darkness, but Uriel, aren't you tired of it too? An endless of cycle...of judgments...of condemnation...of hollow rites repeated.",
"All of this is just a mission bestowed by your so-called  Master at the beginning, and you never once questioned why you accepted it.",
"It's a pity, I think it through clearly, and this battle is my answer to you!",
I'm not surprised that you won. Our battle lasted for thousands of years...but I still can't put you in the deepest prison of hell.,
,
,
"Haha, maybe you still live with a little faith, even if it is faith in yourself... a narcissistic guy.",
,
"Dear, I am really surprised that you are finally willing to come to my Hell Playground?",
"You turned decadence into masquerade and power into decoration. You should have been the person I trusted the most, but now you have reduced to an avatar of pleasure.",
"I just realized a fact: instead of obsessing over conquering or dominating, it is better to enjoy the depravity itself.",
"This is the difference between us. I fell to shatter the old order, while you fell merely to adorn rotting crown of the old world.",
"No, I just know how to enjoy myself, while you, sticking to your so-called ideals, will eventually become the most miserable prisoner in hell.",
"Your degeneration will only breed and spread weakness. The hell I want is a furnace for the strong, not a hotbed of desire.",
"Oh my...it seems that I can't convince you just by talking, so let's dance, like the heart-warming, exciting and dangerous dance we used to do...",
"Ha...you win, what a boring yet wonderful dance...",
"You have power, but you cannot use it well, and you should no longer have any authority over hell.",
"What about you? Continue to play the Savior of Hell? You know that everyone will betray you in the end, just as you betrayed our Creator, right?",
"I never expect loyalty. You can choose your own path, as long as it doesn't stand in my way.",
"Victory is your, yet so is alone. Go, my dear, go to build your throne in hell. I will mourn for you between goblets of revelry and spilled godblood. Hehe...",
"Lucifer, once the brightest morning star in the realm of God, has now become the king of hell. Our destiny is ultimately destined to end in battle.",
"No, it was your stubborn refusal to change that makes this step inevitable. I fell not to betray the light, but to refuse to servitude to your order.",
"You were once my sister, and you and I both knew that the order of heaven was not perfect, but you chose to destroy and reshape rather than correct and guide.",
The guidance you talk about is nothing but hypocritical rhetoric. Real rule must begin with shattering the old order. You just don't want to admit it.,
"You are still as arrogant as before, Lucifer. Today I will not fight for Heaven, but want to give you one last chance. Come back to the Creator with me.",
,
"You win... As you wished, you have defeated the light you mentioned.",
You are wrong. What I want to destroy are the shackles forged in the name of light.,
"You can't turn back. If you gain the genesis power, it won't just be you who will fall... it will be all of us...",
"I have never expected salvation, but if there is to be a new world, it must be built on the will to truly understand truth and order.",
"Humph, then take the power and leave... Carry the world you wish to shape... and the names and glory that the angels once had...",
"As my first feather falls into hell, those names and glory will eventually burn. Farewell, Raphael. In the future, there will no longer be a distinction between angels or mortals in the world.",
"It will be an era where anyone can become a god or morning star, anyone can believe in themselves, and everyone is dominated by will and strength.",
"After going through countless trials in Purgatory, Lucifer was qualified to stand in front of the Creator Sanctum...",
"After entering the gate of the Seventh Divine Realm, Lucifer met the Greek Goddess of Wisdom...",
,
"On the path in the ruins, Lucifer met his enemy who had once hunted and judged him...",
"On the way to the Creator's Altar, Lucifer met an old friend from the past...",
"In front of the Creator's Altar, the holy arbitrator Raphael is waiting for the duel with the fallen angels...",

Elfreya,
Ereos,
Vistara,
Greenorth,
Nature's Messenger,
Spring's Vitality,
Summer's Courage,
Autumn's Wisdom,
Winter's Guardian,
"Elfreya is the guardian of the Spring Lake. In ancient times, she was the elf in charge of the morning mist and lake light. While the world still shivered in winter's grasp, she hummed the melody to summon the warm spring breeze which melted the ice on the lake. Where her song drifted, flowers bloom and wounded souls found solace. Legend has it that when the Spring Goddess found her, she was using her singing to awaken the sleeping earth. Later, the goddess adopted her as a companion, though in truth, she was more like a poet and attendant of the goddess. \nIn addition, she had a bit of artist's temperaments and refused to speak with those she deemed uncultured philistines.",
,
"Vistara is the guardian of the autumn forest, known as the Shadow of Fallen Leaves. She was once a wandering fox in the forest with extraordinary wisdom. She always wear a faint and enigmatic smile, as if she has already glimpsed the fate of all things. \nShe delights in  playing tricks on travelers, but her pranks carry no malice. She hopes to remind people that autumn is not only a season of harvest, but also a time of reflection and change. She is proficient in illusion, skilled in uncovering hidden secrets, and able to peek into past memories among fallen leaves.",
"Greenorth was originally a giant bear slumbering in an ancient glacier. After being awakened by the Winter Goddess, she became her guardian. She was born in the oldest winter, in an age when ice and snow shackled the land. \nHer relationship with the Winter Goddess is like that of a master and a disciple. The goddess taught her how to control her own power, and she protected the goddess with her powerful body and wisdom. \nShe doesn't like to talk much, but her existence itself makes people feel majestic and peaceful. Additionally, she doesn't like noisy sounds, and prefers quiet snowy nights.",
"Did you hear that? The lake is answering my song... Are you here to listen to the poetry of the lake, or to write your own story?",
"Loyalty and courage are not a constraint, but a choice. Just like I chose my goddess...then who would you choose?",
"The fallen leaves know that you have been here, the wind has heard the voice in your heart, and I have foreseen our meeting.",
You came quietly but did not disturb the forest at all... It seems that fate has accepted our encounter.,
The Spring Goddess often said that my singing could awaken all things...but she never knew that sometimes I would rather use it to silence the whole world.,
"Sometimes, I sing to the lake, just to see which flower might bloom in secret for me.",
"Earth remembers footsteps, lakes hold reflections...If one day I leave, what will be left in your heart?",
"I love the dawn sun, love standing atop mountains feeling the first rays of summer sun brushing my shoulders...",
"The Summer Goddess once said that my roar could inspire warriors, but what she didn't know was...I was just yawning after waking up.",
"I've heard all kinds of war cries on the battlefield...but sometimes, I also want to hear the sound of your heartbeat.",
"Some memories will be blown away by the wind, while some are hidden by me in the leaves until the day you find them.",
"Autumn...always tricks us into thinking that everything is over... In fact, the most exciting story are just writing its first chapter.",
,
"I have seen all things slowly fall asleep in the cold winter, and I have also seen hope slowly bloom like frost flowers.",
"The Winter Goddess once said: Guarding is not about roaring and intimidating, but when the blizzard comes, I will stand in front of you.",
"Words are like floating snow, light and quick to fade. The understanding between you and me that is truly buried in our hearts does not need voice...",

Hell's Angel Uriel? I'm really surprised that you're here...,
"You have crossed the line, Ashura, this is not a place for your kind.",
"I just came to see if the Judgment Queen of Hell is really as legendary as it is. In the end, apart from your blushing outfit... it's really boring.",
"It seems that you, who only know how to fight, can't appreciate my aesthetics. However, the Creator's courtyard does not welcome barbarians, especially those who don't follow the rules.",
Rules? That is an excuse the weak make for themselves. I am qualified to stand at the gate of the Creator's courtyard only by breaking the rules that others say.,
"Interesting, if you take one more step, I'll have to send you back to prison with me.",
"Come on, Master Warden, and see if your laws can stand up to my power!",
Not bad... Seems that uniform of yours isn't just for show after all...,
"You can disrespect me, but you have to respect my rules. After all... I rarely show mercy to those who break the rules.",
"I like your ruthless style. Although we have different ideas, I really like your ruthlessness.",
"As for those sinners who escaped from Hell, I think they will suffer a lot, haha...",
"Humph... I promise to prepare a suitable cage for them in advance, and it will have a strong enough lock on it.",
"Stop, Uriel, Creator's power does not belong to a ruthless and rigid judge like you!",
,
"Uriel, have you ever asked yourself: Are those sinners really guilty? If everything has a destiny, you and I are just blind chess pieces.",
"You question judgment because you are tired of responsibility, but I perform my duties because I revere the Creator's covenant.",
"The underworld is not a prison, it is where souls return home. You see it as a place of judgment, but I just want to find a way for them to rest in peace. Even if the cost is to loosen the rules occasionally.",
You have forgotten the meaning of our existence. You were once ordered by the Creator to monitor the dead. Why do you act on your own today?,
,
It looks like you've been lost for a long time. Perhaps I should use battle to remind you of the duty of the God of Death...,
Your faith is much stronger than I thought...,
"As a Hell's Warden, I'm just enforcing the rules, honey.",
"Humph, you will eventually live as a silhouette of rules, Uriel. Pray you don't lose yourself within that hollow shape someday.",
I won't let that happen.,
"How are you, Hell's Angel? You are a step too late. The sinners who escaped from hell have already gone far away. How about you just stop here?",
"Chaos, the Greek God of Origin? You, who reign over order and chaos, how could you tolerate Lilith, Lucifer, and Hell's other fugitives defiling the Creator's courtyard?",
No. I merely granted them a chance to reshape things. Let them compete with you for the Creator's power. The chains of order have imprisoned too much for too long. Hell's gates... will be loosened.,
"You never cared about the consequences, or whether these guys would become the seeds of annihilation again.",
"The consequences? You divide everything into right and wrong, imprisonment and release, but the world is never such a black and white chess game.",
I'm afraid this is how the game will have to go until you beat me.,
"Haha... You can actually keep the power of order from being torn apart in my chaos, what an interesting guy.",
"No matter what your origins are or how powerful you are, there are rules to follow, right?",
"Rules that fail to propel the gods forward are but stagnant waters, unless you rise above them to become the guidance of the gods.",
"When you meet the Creator, you will understand how firm my will is.",
"Wow, you are finally willing to come and arrest me in person? Master Warden. I am truly flattered...",
Releasing those lethally seductive succubi repeatedly and corrupting prison wardens? Your crimes warrant a millennium in chains. Do you truly believe escape remains possible?,
"Don't be so blunt, I just opened a door for them. Whether they want to leave or not is their freedom, isn't it?",
"Freedom does not mean indulgence. You are not giving them freedom, you are just leading them to depravity.",
"Oh, then tell me, what should I do? Lock them up in your little dark room full of torture instruments? Make them cry for forgiveness in pain and pleasure all night long?",
"Honey, you seem to miss that room, I promise to give you a chance to try out my new toy...",
"... I'm really upset about losing to you... Have you ever thought that the tighter the shackles are, the easier they are to break?",
"That's because you disobedient guys keep tearing at it, and my job is to keep recasting the shackles of these rules until they no longer break.",
What are you really protecting with these rules of yours? To listen to the souls in your prison howling? Or is it to please the evil sadists among the gods?,
"I'm not that boring. Everything I do is very simple. I just want to ensure that the order of Hell, the Divine Realm and the human world does not collapse.",
,
"Uriel... I knew you would come, and I also knew that only one of us could go to meet the Creator...",
,
"They have already repented, I just released them from eternal suffering, and they are qualified to regain the light.",
"Repentance does not mean repayment. Their sins have not been cleared and their sufferings have not been fulfilled. Raphael, you are breaking the law just to satisfy your own self-righteous bigotry.",
"Kindness is not weakness, but understanding. You think you are defending justice and order, but in fact you are just trapped in the illusion of judgment and unwilling to walk out.",
"Unfortunately, your compassion is corroding the foundations of the Divine Realm.",
Alas... it seems that we can only communicate with weapons and beliefs.,
It is really hard for me to understand how obsessed you are with judging sinners...,
The weight of this obsession with justice is exactly equal to the price brought about by the collapse of the world.,
"If there is only trial and punishment, who will guide them out of the darkness in the end?",
"You use light to illuminate the path of sinners, and I use instruments of torture to punish them. We each have our own duties.",
"But you never give anyone a second chance, do you?!",
"The second chance will only be a mercy given by the Creator, not our sympathy.",
"Ha... you are finally here, Ruthless Warden, Tyrant of Hell, before I saw you, every minute I spent here seemed like several eras.",
"I am rarely late, but before I judge you, I want to appreciate your fear when facing me.",
"You really haven't changed at all, and you're still as inflexible as you were back then.",
"Flexible? That should be within the scope allowed by the rules. You choose to fall, and I choose to lock you up in the abyss of Hell. This is the meaning of my existence.",
"Do you really think the Creator still cares about these rules? He has long been silent, but you are still holding on to an old covenant and binding yourself for life. How ridiculous.",
"Haha... I don't fight for the will of the Creator at all. I only exist for the rules. You are the first rebel. Prepare to face eternal punishment, my dear.",
"Come on, Uriel, let me see if your rules are worthy of being maintained for a moment in front of the rebels!",
Not a shred of remorse in your eyes... Does the order's chains truly choke you so?,
"Humph, I just can't stand those false gods who are high and mighty but don't have the ability to dominate the world.",
"Your fall was not just a personal betrayal, it tore apart the order of the entire Divine Realm. Countless angels rebelled from the world along with you. You know what this means.",
This simply means that kingship is not eternal! What do you think you are guarding? What you are guarding is just the hypocritical authority that you dare not question!,
"Maybe... but I will continue to do this, even if this duty is destined to be lonely.",
"Whether you are alone or forgotten, you are destined to be trapped in the old laws, and I will be freer than you even if I am full of sins.",
,
Haha... I hope you won't break your promise. I will appreciate it slowly during the eternal time in prison.,
"The Hell's Angel stood in front of the Creator's gate, ready to hunt down the criminals who escaped from prison...",
"After Uriel passed through the gate, she found that the Nordic God of Death had been waiting for a long time...",
,
Uriel found the original succubus who had escaped from her hands countless times...,
,
"In front of the Creator's Altar, the Judge met the first angel in history who committed the sin of betrayal...",

"Freyja, the Nordic Goddess of Star, Magic, and War, was finally summoned by the creator of the Seventh Divine Realm...",

"In front of the Bifrost in the Seventh Divine Realm, Freyja met the most loyal warrior in Northern Europe...",

,
IR Freyja Shard,
Incarnation Summon Scrolls - Freyja,

,
"Not so early! Goddess of War, I'm afraid I can't fulfill your wish until you defeat me!",
"Ember Dragon, the most powerful rage in Northern Europe. Your flames once protected the world, but now you have turned countless stars into scorched earth in order to gain the Creator's power...",
"I cannot let you obtain it, even though we are both guardians of Northern Europe.",
,
A war for destruction is meaningless. The light of the stars cannot be consumed by your raging flames. If you can prove that you are more suitable to dominate war than me...,
Then there's no reason for you to lose to me in this battle. If justice must bloom from fire... then let my stellar power put you to eternal slumber.,
I'm counting on it!,
Cough...I can't believe I can't best you and take your place as the spokesperson of war.,
"The flame will be extinguished by victory or defeat, but the faith will not. Recall your oath. Among the three sacred dragon sworn to protect of Northern Europe, you are the most impulsive, but indeed the most loyal.",
Protect... Oh... Perhaps I have already forgotten the oath in pursuit of power...,
"War shall fade, but the stars' light guides all existence until the new world dawns.",
Humph...it seems that you are indeed more suitable to be a Goddess of War than me.,
"Freyja, the Magic Star of Northern Europe, I heard that you hope to stop the war and create a new order... But war is the gods' destiny, I shall bar your path.",
"Thor, the bringer of Nordic war and thunder... I am not worried about the war, but about the blind faith that is determined to stop me even though I know it is meaningless.",
,
Protect...but true protecting sometimes means igniting war and sometimes means extinguishing hatred. Your obsession is so strong that you cannot sense the direction of your destiny.,
Are you questioning my beliefs?,
"I am questioning the future of the Norse gods, Thor, your power cannot truly regenerate the world, so today I will tell you the true meaning of war.",
This really surprises me. I didn't expect that I would lose to you in this most crucial battle...,
"This transcends victory, Thor... It's about choice. Protection doesn't always demand battle. Even the fiercest sun must embrace eternal order.",
"Haha...it seems that Northern Europe needs more than just thunder, maybe...it also needs a real starry sky.",
"Freyja... the Goddess of Star of Northern Europe, our meeting here is quite dramatic, isn't it?",
"Storm Dragon, once the most glorious guardian of Northern Europe, has now abandoned the sky and headed for the exotic land of the East, just for the so-called higher wisdom.",
,
,
,
Then I swear by the stars that I will show you again where the Truth lies...,
Hah... You've won. Stellar power remains unshaken and the mantle of war still rests in your hands.,
It's just that my oath to Northern Europe have never faded.,
Oath and wisdom... Could it be that they cannot coexist...,
"If your wisdom ran deep enough, you'd see that guardianship and pursuit are not opposed. The winds of the North's future still need your guidance, not exile and dissolution to the East.",
"Maybe... one day, I will return... Until then, I hope your light will still be watching over Northern Europe.",
"Then I vow this to you, the North stars shall never fade.",
"Freyja, Goddess of Star... Why would you, a fellow guardian, confront me on the battlefield of the Seventh Divine Realm?",
"For I have seen you take up arms in pursuit of power that is not yours, Heimdall, and I have felt the rage of hatred burning in your heart.",
,
"I will not allow Asgard to fall, but I will not let war become a belief, nor will I let anger replace your reason.",
"Forgiveness is the beginning of weakness. To shield Yggdrasill's branches, even the gentlest breeze must be cut down.",
"If everything is wiped out in order to protect it, what will be left in the Northern Europe? There are only cold ruins. I will not let you become a new tyrant.",
Then only battle can decide our fate.,
This is impossible... I have no reason to lose... Could it be that the Creator never accepts my beliefs?,
"I'm not trying to defeat you, but just to remind you that protection is not a reason to destroy everything out of anger.",
"Loyalty does not mean cruelty, and guardians must also understand compassion, otherwise what we are guarding is only the desolation brought by war.",
"Maybe you are right... I once thought that my vision could lead the future of Northern Europe, but now, Northern Europe may need your stars to illuminate the distance that I cannot see.",
"Freyja, Goddess of All Stars...your brilliance is causing new turmoil and crisis.",
What are you talking about? I only provide guidance for Northern Europe and never try to stir up any chaos or meaningless disputes.,
"Whether it is direction or change, these are just excuses for turmoil. Only by letting time stop in the wind and snow can the Nordic order be eternal...",
"An order without a future is just a dead tomb. The guardian's duty is to protect the flow of life, not to end it.",
The flow of life breeds sin and betrayal. Only absolute stillness can stop the bloodshed and lamentation in Northern Europe.,
"I understand your pain, but I will not let Northern Europe sleep in eternal night. If you insist on doing this, then the only way for you and me to resolve everything is to fight.",
Good... I hope this is the last battle between the Norse gods.,
Your light is so bright that even the cold winter cannot swallow it up...,
Because I carry the desire of the Nordic people and even all the gods for the future and a new order.,
"...Perhaps I also longed for these things before, but gradually gave up in the long snowstorm.",
"There is no need to hide your inner desires any longer. Protecting Northern Europe is not to make it sleep, but to keep it breathing.",
"As you said, I hope you will eventually obtain the authority of the creator, and may your light illuminate the long-forgotten dreams of Northern Europe.",
"Wow, the brightest gem in Northern Europe actually comes to me in person? Do you want to persuade me to turn back, or do you want to put the shackles of light on me?",
"Loki, your great power over illusion and reality should have been one of the hopes of Northern Europe, not the source of its corruption.",
"Hope? Stop joking. Your so-called hope is nothing more than a firefly adorning the abyss. No matter how much it flickers, it cannot change the fact that the world will eventually collapse!",
"Even if darkness swallows everything, I will ignite the stars in the darkness. This is my oath.",
,
,
"Then let me see how long your star can shine in the chaos. Let's start the show, hehe...",
"Oh... you are so stubborn, Freyja...",
"You can choose to destroy yourself, but you can't take away the future of Northern Europe.",
,
"No matter how dark the sky is, the stars and hope will never go out.",
"Humph... Freyja, when you create a world that I find interesting, perhaps I will give up hypocrisy and illusions and embrace the so-called truth.",

"Not before you get past me, Queen Hera! The war between the Norse and the other gods has being going for far too long, and I don't really want this dispute to continue!",
"Thor...? Heh, it surprises me that you, as the Norse God of War, would say something like not wanting to conquer other pantheons.",
"Perhaps this is not so bad... Your relentless warpath would forge the destiny of the North, and reduce our homeland to ashes in the process.",
"I, who also received the Creator's power, have long since given up the idea of violently conquering the gods; the war has lasted too long and needs to end.",
"You are right, and I shall be the one to decide when.",
"You win... but you better not take my silence as submission, after all, no one can stop my thirst for war.",
"I never expected you to submit. We both understand that not all wars end in obedience, after all.",
"Humph, I thought you'd never learn that.",
"Believe me, I know more than you think. And that's why I'm bound to take the Creator's legacy.",
,
"Hela, the Silent Sovereign of the Netherworld, where every war's end sees countless souls fall into your embrace.",
,
"I've been watching your every move, yet you seem to have long lost interest in the whispers of the dead and forgotten the threads of fate I once wove for you.",
"The destiny you gave me has been cut by my own will long ago, and even the Queen's control is bound to come to an end. Only endless knowledge can now decide my future.",
"It amazes me that you have such an awareness, and now that it's come to this, I'd like to invite you to join me in realizing my ambition of unify the Divine Realm.",
"The Source of Wisdom tells me you don't have it, but if you can beat me in this fight, maybe I'll consider it.",
"...You are always like this, selfishly taking everything under your wing in the name of Queen and authority.",
I don't need death to completely belong to me. All I want is that you're willing to fight to your heart's content on my future battlefields.,
,
"Loki, I was wondering when you were going to come out and stop me.",
"Oh, my Queen, don't make it sound like that. The Norse gods are a family! Didn't you once say I was the foremost mind of the Norse gods?",
"Yet cunning without reverence can be a toxic to the Divine Power, and you have torn the balance of the gods apart more than once.",
"You say balance, but all I hear is obedience. You just want to use the power of the Creator to build a bigger throne.",
"Oh... interesting, the matter of taking all the authority of the Six Pantheons into your own hands, isn't it also what you are looking forward to?",
I'm not interested in that! Ruling is nothing but a burden on me. All I do is to tear apart the false order made by the gods.,
Then I'm going to have to teach you the rules before you get your way.,
Your Divine Power is strong enough to sting me... I thought you were just the incompetent heroine in all those tragedies before.,
"Humph, if you'll put your lunatic ideals to rest, I can still use the Creator's power to create a dream for you, one where you can have all the fun in the world.",
Sounds so tempting... Do you think I would agree to your terms so easily?,
"I don't mind taming you with the pain of my thorns, until you understand the grace of rose.",
Looks like I don't have a choice.,
"Frigga... You're here after all. As the Queen, you don't trust my loyalty to the Norse gods, am I right?",
"Not really. But you have too much in your hands, magic, war, the stars... It is time to tell me about your ideas and ambitions.",
"You ask this because you want me to obey you, just like the other gods of the Norse. All you ever wanted is for the stars and heavens to be at your fingertips.",
,
Is the great Queen finally starting to expand her rule to the other gods?,
"Perhaps I am. Perhaps only then, can true order be restored in the Divine Realm.",
"Unfortunately, I cannot see your rule anywhere in the trails of the stars!",
,
"Rebelling against you has never been my intention. The stars are never about power and obedience, but brightening the future of the gods.",
What if I want your star... to light up a bigger part of the earth?,
"Then I want you to gain my recognition through protection and tenderness, rather than violence and war.",
,
"You should step no further, Queen. As long as you harbor delusions of unifying the Six Gods, I shall be the one to stop you.",
"Alas...You, the most loyal warrior in Northern Europe, would understand my ambitions, or so I thought...",
,
,
"For countless times has Northern Europe sunk into the disaster of invasion by other gods. For countless times have I used this horn to stop the spread of war. Northern Europe refuses to be an invader, but it should not be one either.",
"In that case, I'm afraid there's only one way you can convince me.",
"Then, even if you are the Queen, I can only prove my determination by force.",
Looks like I can't stop you from going down the wrong path.,
"You underestimate the a person's will to guard the Divine Realm. That's it. In terms of power alone, you are no inferior to any of the Norse goddesses.",
"I guard the balance of the gods, not the will of a particular king. If Odin ever goes down the wrong path, I will do my best to stop it.",
"Whether I'm on the right path or not, that's for the Creator to decide, dear.",
...Perhaps you are right.,
"Frigga, Queen of Northern Europe, your desire to control the Divine Realm, and your ambitions, have become unacceptable to me as the ruler of Greece...",
"I don't think you're much gentler than I am, Hera. You dreamed of bringing the gods under your rule, too, didn't you?",
"I don't deny that I've had this thought. But I never hid it under the rosebuds, nor would I kidnap other people's destinies in the name of order.",
,
,
You do not understood the weight of fate nor my determination. If you try to stop me... then I will have to move you aside with my own hands.,
"Let's give it a try, then. Supreme Glory of Northern Europe, I wonder if your power can reverse Greece's destined future!",
...This is not the end I wish to see.Is the future of Greece bound to fall victim to your ambitions?,
"You, like me, harbor pride in your own divine lineage. You, too, wish to be the most dazzling jewel in the eyes of all the gods...",
"The only difference is, perhaps you don't face the cost with determination like mine.",
"...Interesting. I'm more curious about how you,with the power of creation, would build a perfect Divine Realm in your mind.",
"Oh... I promise you won't be bored, my dear. There can only be one Queen. But there will be a place for you and the Greek gods in the Queen's rose garden.",

Seraphel Core -Apostle of Chaos,
Is this... the Court of the Seventh Divine Realm?! Standing before this gate... could it mean the Creator wills to bequeath His power unto me?,
Why are you still waiting for His answer? Maybe hesitation still lingers on your heart. Are you still questioning the nature of being chosen? Whether it's an honor... or a shackle?,
,
,
,
,
"Unfortunately, the lighthouse is usually the god themselves. In order to shine bright enough, you'll have to burn yourself.",
If you still hesitate...let me shatter those doubts.,
"Huh... Looks like the sun you're after still burns within your heart, does it not?",
"If inheriting the Creator's power means that I can enlighten more beings, I should not hesitate to accept it...",
,
Stop right there! This is no place for a wavering mind!,
The witch from a foreign land... the fearless war spirit of Japan... are you Himiko?,
"Can you see the Gods, Jeanne d'Arc? ...in the wind, in the fire or in your heart? Without an unswerving heart, how can you bear the gaze of the Creator?",
I never claimed to be worthy of becoming a god. I simply heeded the call and faced trials.,
"I see a blazing obsession in your heart. You are like me... both candidates of the Creator. But in the end, only one of us can reach His altar.",
And that shall be decided by our swords and will...,
"To be honest, I never thought I could defeat a powerful martial artist like you...",
"No, the reason you bested me is not your flawless skills, but your will to wield your weapon despite your hesitation.",
Perhaps I should thank you for making me face my inner self. I did doubt whether I was worthy of shouldering the power of a god...,
"But now I understand that belief is never about being unshakable, but about standing firm, even when it bleeds.",
,
Are you ready to face the sins you can never forgive? Because Gods' mercy without an edge is but indulgence in disguise.,
"The Angel of Hell... Uriel? I do not deny your words. Justice does require clear borders, but mercy is not the cowardice you speak of.",
"If becoming a god means cutting off all mercy, then I would rather face all the world's vicissitude as a mortal.",
"What a pity. Mortals have the right to weep, but gods cannot yield to mercy. Come now, let me test your compassion, see if it is worthy of enduring the laws of the Gods!",
"... I thought you would lower your sword before me, but you neither fled nor compromised. It seems I underestimated you.",
"It's not part of my belief to judge who deserves redemption and who should be cast into the deepest hell. Rather, it is about not to ignite the flames of hatred even when facing any enemy.",
"If Gods cannot empathize the struggling kindness, how can they guide the mortals?",
"Heh... You are indeed not a qualified judge, but you are a qualified guide. Go forth, the next trial waiting for you.",
"Jeanne d'Arc, your past sacrifice was a morning sun illuminating the night. But if you were to inherit the power of creation, can you guide the Gods as you once guided the mortals?",
"Not all Gods long to embrace the light. They need time to understand faith, rather than being forced to look up to it.",
"Then are you prepared to be misunderstood, even suspected and opposed, just like the sacrifice you once endured?",
"If the righteousness of light can only be forced upon people, then it's only pain it shall bring. The warmth brought by light should be a breeze in spring, not a blazing fire.",
"Well... If you have such resolve, perhaps you can achieve what even many Gods cannot. Come now, let me witness your determination.",
You haven't even fully used the power bestowed by the Creator. You confront me with nothing but a mortal will... The path you walk is indeed different from that of other Goddesses.,
"But we both wish for the Gods to see the path ahead. In that sense, we are the same.",
"If your light can dispel the darkness in the Gods' hearts, then I shall yield a corner of the sky to you. Go now, the path to the altar lies not far ahead.",
"Heh? Lady Saint, have you finally come to find me? Does the sight of me always remind you to save more fallen beings of my kind?",
"Not quite. Because you don't need to be saved, at least not in a way against your will.",
,
"Hah... so novel, but you know what? I've seen too many so-called lofty people who reject temptation while craving it in their hearts.",
"Do you truly understand the Gods? They long for your noble light, yet they also crave the desires I promise them.",
"I have bled, longed for love, and endured fire and loneliness... But that's exactly why I have the confidence to redeem the Gods from darkness.",
Interesting... It seems I do need to give you a little test...,
Tsk... You really didn't hold back. But I've glimpsed your heart: you don't want to deny your desires. Only that refusing them has become the Gods' only choice.,
"I respect desires, for it is part of humanity and even the Gods. But if I cannot guide the gods beyond them, I do not deserve the Creator's favor.",
"You're one of the few who don't want to purify me yet still wish to change the world. But let me warn you, the being you're about to face won't be as reasonable as I am.",
"You've finally arrived, Jeanne d'Arc... Have you come to witness my acquisition of the Creator's Power, or to contend with me for this final glory?",
,
"Divine Will? My dear, aren't you naive. I was the very first vessel of the will, the first to hear His words and thoughts.",
"And now, I am the Fallen Angel cast into the abyss by Him. Do you understand how much I've paid?",
"You rebelled because you could not accept the fact that He bestowed glory upon mortals. But I will not disdain my fellow beings, even if this faith should once more cast me into the flames.",
"I rarely think highly of mortals, but today I will challenge the fate again. If mortals truly possess unimaginable potential as the Creator said...",
Then I shall rethink the decisions I made as a fallen one.,
"You've won, Jeanne d'Arc. You've triumphed over one of the most powerful angels in the Divine Realm...as a mere mortal.",
But you didn't fight me with your full strength... am I right?,
Humph... I merely wanted to see if the once-humble Jeanne d'Arc would also become an arrogant demon like me after gaining infinite Wonder Power.,
Do you think I will become like you?,
"Heh... I don't know, but I hope you remember that becoming a God is not the end of all trials. Instead, it's the beginning of a new one.",
,
I shall look forward to the day you choose the path of depravity and meet me in hell. Heh heh...,
"Jeanne d'Arc, once a mortal, now stands before the gates of the Seventh Divine Realm...",
,
"On the path to the Creator's Altar, Jeanne d'Arc encounters the most merciless being among all the angels...",

"We finally stand before this gate. To obtain the Creator's Power, we must have independent souls...",
"This may also mean that we will eventually part ways. Sister, I don't know if this is good or bad...",
"The outcome has never been something we can guess. You are like two shadows above and below the water, who is the reflection and who is the real one?",
We are now just two sides of a same soul.,
"No, you can feel it, right? Sister, our souls are repelling each other. Only by completely separation or merging into one can we accept the Creator's Power...",
"But I think it's very interesting like this! You can see different worlds and have different ideas, yet you share the same soul and freedom.",
"However, this does not mean that pain does not exist. We also want to get rid of conflicts and the deep-seated disputes in our souls.",
"What we need is power, a power that enable us to accept the Creator. But the paths our fate are destined to cross with yours here.",
Interesting. Let me see the direction given by fate.,
"In the battle... you were trying to guide us, so we could work with instead of against each other. Am I right?",
Hmm... Because I didn't want to hurt you. I just... wanted to see how your hearts would respond to each other.,
You are not fundamentally opposed; you are just different ripples on the same lake. There is no need to fear the divergence of souls.,
Perhaps...,
,
"Like you said, Capricornus, my fellow constellation messenger, the trajectories of the stars' fates have long been determined.",
We need independent souls and resolute will. Only in this way can we accept the Creator's Power.,
"This is too idealistic... Independent souls sound beautiful, but have you ever considered that the other side might disappear?",
"Your personalities, emotions, and values are all against each other's.A fusion would not be a choice but rather, a compromise. And a compromise... means the other side's utter sacrifice.",
"We have already made up our minds. If you also seek something from the Creator, then only the winner can move forward.",
"Heh, what a stubborn pair of twins... I merely stated the price to pursue the Creator's Power.",
"But if you insist, perhaps I can see your determination after a fight.",
"Humph, looks like your obsession with the Creator's Power is not so different from mine.",
"I just... didn't want you to succeed. I have seen too much loss, especially the kind of loss when your wish has come true, but more have been lost.",
"We have fears, too. But we will not escape. You are right that having independent souls means giving up some things... but that is a sacrifice we have decided to have.",
Are you really willing to accept the possibility of losing each other for the Creator's Power...?,
If fate must be so arranged.,
...Then proceed. I hope you will not regret it.,
"Athena, our mentor.. the Goddess of Wisdom who guided our transformation from constellations into human form. Now, are you also standing on the other side of us?",
"...You want to have independent souls and inherit the Creator's Power, but do you know what that means?",
"It means complete understanding and unity. No more disputes, no more chaos.",
It also means completeness. Only a complete us can bear that power.,
,
"But the differences cause us pain... We struggle every moment, and every decision eventually turns into a quarrel.",
"That is precisely your value. The Creator isn't seeking a flawless will, but a heart that can embrace contradictions and curb chaos.",
"If you can't work together and improve in this state, even if you merge into one, you'll create an empty and lonely soul.",
Then let us prove in battle whether we can find such a heart you speak of...,
"Well fought. At least now, you've learned to listen to each other.",
"Our hearts still argue. But this time, we're arguing for the same goal.",
"This is the bud of wisdom. True wisdom lies not in right or wrong, but in walking together even amid contradictions.",
Does this mean we've passed your trial?,
Yes. Having independent souls doesn't mean erasing each other. It means resonating. Only then are you worthy to inherit the Creator's legacy.,
"Are you two really looking to merge into one? The way you used to bicker was actually kind of cute, you know.",
"Unfortunately, being cute can't help us bear the Creator's Godhood or solve the pain of tearing a soul apart.",
But as the Goddess of Love... shouldn't you support us in becoming a more complete individual?,
"What are you talking about! The true meaning of love... has never been making two souls the same, but being willing to embrace the different other half.",
"Heh, the Creator must have created this opportunity for us to meet in His courtyard, just so I can test you here!",
We think you just want an excuse to be mischievous...,
"Stop now! I yield, I yield! You two fought harder than even I did!",
It seems you didn't fight us with all your strength. Were you... testing us?,
You guessed it! I just wanted you to know that love doesn't make two hearts into one; it makes two hearts beat together.,
"Be it Gods or mortals, everyone will follow the guidance of my bow and arrow to find their other half, even if that half is imperfect.",
...,
"Why are you staring at me! I admit my guidance has caused some trouble, I still believe I didn't misjudge the bond between you two.",
"I hope so, interesting little one.",
Your journey ends here. I can't allow you to use the Creator's Power to change the destined fate...,
"The controller of the fate of the Japanese Gods... is that you, Enmusubi?",
,
"However, I'm afraid the ropes of fate cannot restrain our obsession. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come here to stop us, would you?",
"What you have to face in the end is not me, but fate itself. I'm just a spokesperson. In any case, this battle will decide everything...",
"I'm surprised... Your still choose to accept each other amid contradictions, even at the risk of losing this battle.",
Because we realize that threads can be restraints or connections.,
We don't need to eliminate each other. We just need to seek common grounds despite the differences.,
"Looks like you understand the essence of fate: it's not being bound by destiny, but weaving countless possibilities stitch by stitch, and choosing the most suitable path among all possibilities.",
"Maybe it's destined for twins to oppose each other, but we can choose how to face this divergence. We won't resist, run away, or be that desperate to merging into one anymore.",
Then I no longer need to stop you. I hope you can use the Creator's Power to weave the future of the Gods.,
You've finally reached this point... The twin souls that exist within one body yet repel each other.,
"I admire your courage, but two stars can't be in the same orbit after all... This is an unchangeable rule of the ecliptic.",
"We just want to know after all these trials and struggles: does the Creator only accept a single, independent soul?",
"You think that unity brings order, but a truly harmonious star map is maintained not by unity, but by the balance of gravity and distance.",
"If you can't coordinate in your differences, even if you obtain the Creator's Power, you'll self-destruct like binary stars deviating from their orbits.",
"Then let this trial begin. Not to prove who should disappear, but to prove that two imperfect existences can also weave their own sea of stars.",
Very well. Let the stars witness whether you deserve the right to redefine unity.,
What a well-cooperated and smooth battle. It seems you've understood how to view each other...,
"We've abandoned the idea of merging into one, and we no longer define unity and freedom with independent souls.",
,
"Heh... As the guardian of the stars, perhaps there's no more reassuring answer to hear than this one.",
"You've earned the right to wield the Creator's Power, not because you eliminated each other, but because you finally acknowledged each other.",
May the Creator's Power in our hands guide the fate of the Gods.,
"The incarnation of Gemini arrives before the Creator's Courtyard, seeking a prophecy of their mutual destiny...",
"After entering the gate of the Creator's courtyard, they meet another tragic incarnation of the Zodiac...",
"On the path to the Creator's Altar, the twins encounter their former mentor and friend...",
"In the depths of the ruins, waiting for the twins is a little angel who has caused trouble for the Gods countless times...",
"Not far from the Creator's altar, the Japanese Goddess of fate blocks the twins' path...",
"Before the Creator's Altar, Freyja, the Nordic Goddess of War and Ruler of All Stars, foreshadowed the twins' final trial...",

"He... so this is the so called Seventh Divine Realm, the Creator's Courtyard? Disappointing...I deserve better than this.",
"Stop right there, Loki! This is not your playground,  nor would you be invited by the Creator!",
"I hear the whispers of flames, the echoes of broken oaths by the old Gods...You are the incarnation of that whisper and the primal wrath of this world.",
"I wrath not to communicate, but to show my will; and the flames are not here to whisper, but to stop you from moving forward!",
"Interesting one. I would like to see if you, the servant of Odin, one of the three guardian dragons of Northern Europe, have what it takes to stop me.",
"You know I never say no to a fight, be it a winning one or a losing one.",
You'll regret it soon enough.,
How are you not consumed by my flames...,
"You don't remember me as anything other than Goddess of Mischief, right? Let alone the Fire Goddess of Northern Europe. I am in control of fire, not its slave.",
"In human history, fire has always been a means to record civilization. But all I want with it is build more lies.",
Humph...let's see if you can say something like that when facing the Creator.,
You'll have quite a show to watch.,
The incarnation of chaos and hypocrisy. You are earlier than I expected. What lie do you intend to use to shatter the ice of order?,
"I'm not so interested in your coldness, dear.",
"I thought you were fire, but you're more like a block of ice in front of me...Our fates are intertwined, yet no mark is ever left.",
"The world moves, Guardian of Ice. I am the mirror that reflects everything, and you will see your true self in my eyes.",
I can say the same to you. You never stopped to see who you actually are.,
"Because there is no actual me. My essence, my soul...they are but an everchanging illusion.",
"Huh...That's such a shame. But in the very least, I won't allow such a soul a part of the Creator's legacy.",
"Unfortunately, this illusory soul isn't that easy to dispel.",
"You didn't flinch before my all-freezing ice, and still remained your ability to shift under my power.",
"Chaos does not the completely reject order, but the world needs to be reminded, that order is but a temporary illusion.",
You are hard to read. No one knows what horrible things you will do with the Creator's power...but at least you've past the Creator's test.,
"Leave that to fate, then. I am the first snowflake in an avalanche. Nothing more.",
"Loki...the Goddess of Deception and Mischief, your ambition ends here!",
"Storm Dragon, one of the three Guardian Dragons of Northern Europe, the embodiment of wisdom...I thought I could avoid you. What a pity.",
"Your little tricks may have fooled my sister, but not me.",
But you're no longer in Northern Europe. You are standing on the realm of Eastern Gods. Do you still have to stop me?,
"The wind moves with circumstances, but wisdom and truth stay where they are. I left Northern Europe seeking truth, but I do not stand and watch my land being threatened by hypocrisy and deception.",
Looks like you are well aware of what I want with the Creator's power. How are you planning to stop me?,
"Wisdom is my blade and lightening is my sword. Loki, you will have to go through my storm if you want to inherit the Creator's power!",
"You won. Not because you're smarter, but because of your resolve and obsession...this wisdom is dangerous.",
You remain the most dangerous being in Northern Europe...and the loneliest one.,
Loneliness is the price for wisdom. I need no companion. All I need is the Creator's power and building the world I want with it.,
"Go meet the Creator, then. I hope that you won't have to conceal your heart and desire under deception one day.",
Huh...I simply haven't decided what my true self is yet.,
Loki. I think it's time to remind you that Creator's power comes with a cost. Are you ready for it?,
,
"It won't be that easy this time. The Creator will not allow your little trick. If you want to deceive fate one again, you'll have to go through me.",
"Make you move then, Lord of Death. Do I look like someone who fear to dance with Death?",
"Oh? As one of the disciples of Creator, I'm more than happy to send you to the palace in Underworld and keep you there for thousands of years.",
You've fled death once again. Are you lucky or does the fate have other arrangements?,
"How do you think I won? Darling, it's neither deception nor talent. It's my refusal to believe fate that led me to victory.",
"You're such a tragedian, refusing to accept the fate like every other creatures, messing around and make your own end a myth.",
Hehe...at least I get to write my own scrip before the world ends in void.,
"You've past my test, but I have to tell you: if you ever sit on the throne of the Creator, everything you touch will be covered in the shadow of deception.",
"Don't you worry. Even if that's true, I'll make a happy ending for this world in that shadow of deception.",
"You have come, Loki. I thought you would avoid me, like the many truths told by the stars you've avoided before.",
"Truths don't mean anything unless they can bring chaos and change. You know that, Lord of Stars.",
"Chaos is just another name for undecided fate, Loki. You are making excuses for eluding it.",
Choice is a fool's illusion. People in charge of future never ask the fate's opinion.,
Good. Let's see if you can break out of the trajectory set for you by the stars.,
Looks like breaking out of that chain of fate isn't that hard after all.,
Humph. You will never break out of your own deception. You fear for truth is your most unbreakable shackles.,
"...You can see my ending, can't you?",
"I see you winning every battle, but losing to eternal loneliness...and your own hypocritical soul.",
"I'm happy to lose to myself, compared with losing other Gods.",
"Loki, this is the end of your journey. At the end of the Rainbow Bridge lies the Creator's altar...but the power on it is not yours to trifle with!",
"After so many years, you still talk like the endless pine trees in Northern Europe, poignant and dull.",
Why don't you move aside and let me talk to the Creator? I promise it'll end much more nicely than you think.,
"Pretty words. What I guard is the glory of the Creator, not a shortcut for a traitor.",
But you are not Him. Only He gets to define traitors and heirs.,
"Very well. If you trump me, I'll think about what your words.",
"No point in struggling. Just like the end of Ragnarok, your defeat can't be changed, darling.",
"Stop it. Even if you have bested me, do you actually believe that the Creator's power would accept someone who wants to fill the world with deception?",
The Creator isn't that narrow-minded. I'm fully aware that He has been watching me. He has been waiting for me to inherit his power since I told my first lie.,
"And I will show him whether the creation of Loki, the Goddess of Mischief, will outlive this real but hopeless world.",
"Having past the first trial of the Creator, Loki has gained a chance to stand before Him...",
"After the flames of Purgatory, the most powerful Guardian of Ice in Northern Europe stands before her...",
"Outside the Courtyard of Wisdom, Loki meets the first embodiment of wisdom in Northern Europe...",
"In the deep of the Courtyard of Wisdom, Loki meets the most powerful sage in Northern Europe...",
"Not far away from the Creator's Altar, the Goddess of Stars and War is waiting for Loki...",
"Before the Creator's Altar, the two nemeses of Ragnarok meet again...",

Trickery,
Well...isn't this the Seventh Divine Realm? Little more than ruins now. This reminds me of the once-glorious city of Atlantis.,
"Poseidon, Goddess of the Sea? No...I'm now looking at the incarnation who's walking the path of creation. I'm surprised to see you here.",
"Icarus... a mortal pursuing the sun and truth. With your illusory ideals and faith, you won't understand the Creator's will.",
"I've already fallen once, so I know the cost of light as well as the danger of the sea. However, I keep pursuing truth, because that's the meaning of my life.",
"Who lent you a hand when you fell? The sun didn't help you, nor did the sea stop roaring. You are not the heir to Creator's power.",
"I'm afraid I won't agree to that. You, too, once lost to Zeus, and yet you still chose the challenging path, didn't you?",
"Whatever happens, I'll shatter your waves with the wings that once fell.",
You haven't changed a bit. You're still that soul that charges into danger without fear...knowing your defeat.,
"Nor have you forgotten about your heart. You're well aware that you are the glory at the center of Olympus's tempest, not a coward hiding behind a wall.",
Humph. Face the Creator with me then. You are not the answer I'm looking for...but perhaps you are a beacon on my journey.,
,
"Finally, Goddess of the Sea from Olympus...or should I say, the future Creator?",
"You are supposed to be long forgotten in the flames of Olympus, Prometheus. You are not qualified to stop me.",
,
Interesting. Do you think I stand before you for power? No. I just want to see if the one in charge of the sea would do something worse to humans than Zeus did.,
,
"Even if the Gods stop giving, the mortals will survive with their wisdom. When the day Gods are no longer relied upon comes, what would be the point of being a ruler?",
"Unfortunately, I never thought that mortals relied on us, nor will I allow anyone to steal the power of the Creator.",
"Step forward, then. Let's see if your resolution can extinguish my undying will.",
"You are no less powerful than I am, Prometheus. But the mercy you have held you back.",
,
,
"Also the most dangerous illusions. If you want to create a new world, you should stop thinking about tsunamis alone, but see what light you can bring to humans.",
No promises. But I'll think about what you've said when I see the Creator.,
"I saw you coming, Poseidon. You are willing to challenge destiny itself for Creator's power.",
"Destiny? I'm conquered countless tempests, and destiny is but a sail, easily shredded.",
"Destiny is the course on ocean. The Creator needs a captain to steer the ship and follow the course, not some adventurer who doesn't stick to the plan.",
"Always patronizing, Apollo. How much do you understand the unpredictable sea after all?",
,
"You just know how to get on my nerves, huh? Let's see if you can fight like you talk!",
I never enjoyed fighting you. But I respect your courage to face any foe.,
"You just do what you please, don't you? Striking all your enemies relentlessly like a sea wave, and never turning back.",
I don't deny my desire to rule everything. But perhaps you're right. The heir to Creator's power should also consider the harmony of all things.,
"I'm not asking you to trust me, but don't lie to your own heart. In the sea of destiny, your voice is both the guidance and the tsunami.",
"Chaos, the origin of everything and Mother of all Gods in Greece. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to face you.",
"Don't fret, darling. Since we're already here, that means we have a common goal.",
"Answer me, do you crave rule and order, or chaos and destruction?",
"Rule and order, no doubt.",
"Sadly, you're being drawn into chaos when you think you're taming it. Control comes from power, which is also the sweet trap of chaos...",
"I'm not here for these words, Chaos. You, too, shall bow before my order, even if you are the primal chaos.",
"Then come, darling. Let's see if your tide is actually capable of traversing endless darkness...",
You...you are so vile and yet awe-inspiring.,
What you hate is your own heart. I'm merely a mirror that reveals your unknown self.,
I thought order meant controlling everything. But your silence in our fight was deafening.,
You only seek order to run away from your fears. You'll have to face that if you want to inherit Creator's position.,
Or you shall becoming the next source of chaos and disasters...,
I'll keep that in mind.,
"It's been a long time, Hera. Even in the land of the Seventh Divine Realm, your courtyard is still so breathtaking.",
And you are still so arrogant. Has my untamable queen of the sea changed at all?,
"I didn't expect the Creator to put you in front of me. Is this a trial, or a warning?",
"A trial, no doubt. It tests whether you deserve the strength that dominates all. You crave power, but resort to violence all the time.",
"Aren't you a slave to power as well, Hera?",
"Humph, of course not. I guard the glory of the Olympus, while all you want is to the world on its knees to your rules.",
"Glory or rules, they are just different words. Come, Hera. If you think you can move my waves, I will acknowledge your crown!",
"...You've changed, Poseidon. You used to walk over your enemy's body, but now you've gone soft.",
"Oh, it's simply that as the Creator, I will show some generosity towards my foes.",
You used to see nothing but conquering and plundering. But today you're starting to look like a true lord.,
,
I hope you can bring changes indeed. Go forth then. Take the power you deserve.,
Poseidon? What a surprise. I thought it would be Hades who fights with me for Creator's power here.,
Do you actually think she is interested to leave the Underworld and waste time with you? Or am I not qualified to stand here?,
"That tongue of yours. I remember the last time we fought for the dominion over Olympus, when you were exactly the same.",
"I fight for myself alone this time. If you want me to submit to your thunder, I'd rather drown the whole Divine Realm with the ocean.",
"You are always so naive, thinking you can carry the world on your shoulders and decide the fates of all the gods.",
"I will carry the weight of fate, but never succumb to it. You are not an obstacle, Zeus. You are the destination I have to reach.",
Good. Show me if you can shatter my thunder.,
Looks like the title of the lord falls to you this time.,
"No, I've merely put my heart to rest after this fight.",
There's serenity and tenderness in your sea now. Looks like the creator didn't choose you accidentally.,
"I will take a good care of the storm between Gods, just like how you saved Olympus so many times before.",
"Then the Creator made the right call. If you don't deserve that crown one day, I'll take it back.",
"Poseidon stands before the gate of the Seventh Divine Realm, but the Creator doesn't intend to make her journey an easy one...",
"Behind the gate of the Creator's Courtyard, the hero who stole fire for mortals tries to stop Poseidon...",
"Outside the Courtyard of Wisdom, Apollo is waiting for a destined meeting...",
"Facing the Creator from Greece, the Goddess of the Sea falls into a dilemma...",
"On the way to the Creator's Altar, the Celestial Empress fights the Goddess of the Sea for throne...",
"Before the Creator's Altar, the ultimate fight between thunder and tide is about to begin. The power belongs to only one of them...",
"Proud, persistent, elegant",
"Observing storms, studying the ocean, collecting treasures, drinking, travelling",
Someone who can help herself reclaim the throne of the Olympus.,
"With the Creator's favor, after the trial in the Seventh Divine Realm, Poseidon has not only reclaimed the title of Goddess of the Sea in Greece, but gained the power to reshape the world.\nThe Creator believes that she's an highly efficient ruler with great ambition. Perhaps the Divine Realm will thrive under her rule.",
A lord fears no authority. Why should the sea concern itself with the opinion of a breeze?,
"Your soul doesn't belong to the sea, but I'll allow you... to leave a reef with your name on it in my heart.",

Why do you humans look more pious wishing on your phone than praying to me?,
"Phone signal is easier to find than a god, after all.",
"Humph, is that so? A phone might disconnect, but my answer to prayers is ever-present.",
Emm? Are you jealous?,
I'm not that petty. I'm only by your side because of your prayers. That I'll admit.,
The way you look at me...do you think a Goddess would be influenced by the look on your face?,
Are you being influenced?,
"I...I'm not! If I actually were, then..there would be a storm at the sea right now!",
Am I... making you uncomfortable?,
"N-no, I'm just surprised that you care about my feelings...",
Do you really like those fried octopuses on those fuming stalls? They look more dangerous than a sea monster...,
Are you worrying about me?,
"No, I'm not. You will remember my warning when you have a diarrhea, humph!",
Are you speaking for the octopuses?,
"Come on, I was more than happy too see those things crawling around in my temple getting caught by humans.",
I see boys yelling the names of the girls they love at the sea. What do you think of that?,
At least they trust the sea.,
"Yeah, the sea wouldn't tell their secret to anyone, would it?",
Wouldn't it be better to confess their love directly?,
"Unfortunately, such bravery is a rarity whatever era you're in. Especially those who dare to say it in front of me.",
I don't like The Little Mermaid. The protagonist is just too soft.,
I agree.,
"As the offspring of the sea, she should speak her mind to the whole world, not losing her voice for love.",
I don't think so.,
So you believe that love is strong enough to conquer a tsunami? That's a surprise...,
"Wine, rose, movies... humans' obsession with romance has more tricks than the thorns on a coral.",
Do you like those too?,
"...Sometimes. If the wine is pure, the rose is gorgeous and the movie is good enough.",
What do you consider romantic?,
Romantic? Isn't holding onto each others hands in a storm romantic enough?,
"Your soul doesn't belong to the sea, but I'll allow you... to leave a reef with your name on it in my heart.",

Is this...Creator's courtyard? Looks like the truth I'm looking for lies deep within this yard.,
"Horus, guardian of Egyptian Deity and Thrones. In the name of Goddess of Wisdom and War, I cannot let you through this gate without approval of justice!",
"Athena of Greece, huh? You have shield of wisdom, but you don't see the scorching sun. With the order of the Divine Realm collapsed, who shall be the judge of justice?",
"The yardstick of justice is neither power nor glory. It's sense of judgement. If you truly see so clearly, then prove it to me. Prove if you can see the essence of truth.",
"I've seen mirage in ancient desert, and tides of fate in the dawn of a bloodbath. The blade of truth scares me not.",
"Come, then, let that blade strike! O Judging Eye of Egypt, let us see if insight defeats brute force, or does the scorching sun melt voice of reason?",
"You didn't yield, nor did you put me to slumber. I can see clearly, Athena. I've won.",
"You won the battle, but not my order. But you've earned yourself the right to move forward. Understand the weight of truth.",
"The truth remains the truth. It only reveals itself when faced directly. I hope by moving forward, I have both your mercy and anticipation.",
"Go forth, Horus. The sun shines upon the victor and traveler alike.",
"Asura, Goddess of War from Purgatory? I can't say I'm not surprised to see you here.",
"I am but another test from the Creator, Horus. You seek the truth, but fail to look directly into your desires.",
"Sadly, I don't have the so-called desires in my heart. All I ever do is rebuilding order among the gods.",
Your serious look is bugging me. Even your aura of killing is too...orderly. You look like a legal code in a cage to me.,
"Order isn't a cage, but a choice. My power has rules, because chaos cannot bring order.",
"Then you are a slave to the crown, unworthy of godly power. Come, let go of your codes and show me your wrath!",
As you wish. Let's see if you can shake my will at full display.,
"I see your sky-tearing strength beneath that serious look now. Not bad, eagle in a cage.",
"The only language you speak is brutality, but I can win without giving up self-discipline.",
"I underestimated you, Guardian of Egypt.",
"I follow order for a faith bigger than me. I will fight formidable foes when it's necessary, for my faith.",
"Stop right there, Horus! The gate I watch does not open for a deviant guardian like you!",
"Heimdall, the Strongest Shield of Northern Europe? What do you mean by that? I have never strayed from my oath or position.",
"You once swore to protect the order of the gods, never to wield your sword to someone other than your kind. But now you are fighting for the powerful but dangerous power of creation?",
"Because the world has fallen into slumber, and a guardian shouldn't keep standing by. I need stronger power as long as chaos keeps spreading.",
"When your sword is pointed at the future, do you see the beings your once protected trembling beneath your feet? Do your hands of guardian cover the sun also?",
"An ark is all I will be. An ark sailing towards light, like I always have. I assure you, this power will only be used to keep peace in the Divine Realm.",
"Show me that with your sword, then.",
"Your command of order and temperance is quite impressive. Although I was testing your boundaries with each hit, your power was always within control.",
"Even if my power may cause harm some day, I will be stopped. I have the strength to wield a sword, and the courage to put it down when I no longer deserve it.",
"You are closer to the truth than many of us. Not because you've passed my trial, but because you've chosen to become light itself.",
"The meaning of guardian lies not in the end, but in the process.",
"Horus, Messenger of the Nile. You have to go through me first if you are heading to Creator's Altar.",
"Himiko, Samurai of Yamato. Your faith and perseverance in Japanese Gods and chivalry is impressive. But I see no need for a fight between us.",
"Yes, there is. To me, you are not worthy of the Creator's will.",
"The truth you seek is but the glory of Egyptian Royals. But glory ends. In time or in space. To the Japanese, this is selfishness.",
"It's not selfishness, it's the pillar of order. How can a god be relied upon without building a name? The truth remains the truth. Otherwise, how can it survive for thousands of years?",
"Faith needs to converge before being lost in chaos. I protect not the formality, but the spirit with which we stick together. When the gods aren't even standing together, how should the mortals behave?",
"If there truly are more than one sun, I would be the most unswerving one. I don't need to be understood to keep standing.",
"You talk much like Amaterasu, the major deity of Japan. In that case, I shall test your resolute with this blade.",
"You have an unbending will. In the fight with you, I see the traits needed for a ruler: fearless and selfless.",
,
I hope you stand with what you believe till the end.,
I shall remain true to my duty. Always.,
"Horus, you stand before me at last. There can only be one lord at the pinnacle of the pyramid. Do you believe in your heart that with light in control, you can reveal truth?",
"I will continue your legacy, not replace you. You were once my teacher and faith, but now... your fate has been remaining still.",
"Therefore, I no longer look up to you. I need to fly further, and shine upon those places you couldn't make to.",
"Come, then, my former guardian! If you have truly made up your mind, prepare to traverse my radiance, my silence, my solitude, and my burden!",
,
"You finally see it. Light exists not to be witnessed, but to endure even when unseen.",
I thought inheritance was a kind of replacement. Now... perhaps 'transcendence is a better word.,
"You are not the sun, nor do you need to be. You are Horus, the descendant of light, and the watcher with her back to the light while moving forward.",
"Thank you, my mentor. You didn't point me the right way, but you help me find my own path.",
You... you are my own shadow? I thought my justice and light allowed no parasite of darkness.,
"No, I'm everything you deny: your hesitation, anger, the suffering of mortals you can't interfere in. I'm what you try to look away from in silence.",
But I am Horus herself! I cannot let those thoughts take root in my heart!,
"You can ignore them, but you can't deny them. You ask truth from the gods, but never ask yourself if you're worthy of it.",
If bearing truth means sacrificing myself to the abyss... then I would rather draw my sword and sever this phantom of the past!,
"Humph... you have bested me. But every strike carried hesitation. You don't dare to deny me, because I AM you.",
"As you say, I don't deny your existence. But you will be buried deep within my heart, as a warning. Not a ruler.",
"You finally admit it. We are two souls in one body. Go forth, face the Creator and the end to your fate.",
"Perhaps you are right. But when I face you again, I hope it's not because of fear, but understanding.",
"Horus stands before the gate of the Seventh Divine Realm, seeking the truth within her heart...",
"Behind the door to the Creator's Courtyard, the Guardian of Egypt encounters the most dangerous of all goddesses...",
,
"On the path to the Creator's Altar, the doubtful samurai of Yamato blocks Horus' advance...",
"Before the final gate leading to the Creator's Altar, Horus beholds her mentor once more...",
"At the Creator's Altar, Horus confronts her own unseen side...",
