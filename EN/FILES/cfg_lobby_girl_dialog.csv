1,2047,2,Humans suffer so much frustration and betrayal in romance. I wonder if they still believe in love.,At least I believe!,I do not know either...,Good answer! Doesn't love appear precious because of many hardships?,"Your tone makes you sound bitter and jaded. There's no need for that. With me at your side, your luck with love will be much better.",,,,,10
2,2047,2,Do you have a crush on a special someone? Would you like for me to use one of my arrows to make her fall in love with you?,I totally agree!,I disagree.,"Right? After all, if gods are so different from humans that they can't share a deep love with them, I would rather not be a god!","... After all, humans have short lifespans. And, sadly, their love dies with them.",,,,,10
3,2047,1,Do you have a crush on a special someone? Would you like for me to use one of my arrows to make her fall in love with you?,I'm too embarrassed to say!,"Yes, I do!","If you don't tell me who it is, then I'll write your name on an arrow and shoot it out blindly! Do you really want to leave it up to chance?",So which lucky girl will my arrow of love strike? Wait... This arrow seems to be targeting me?!,,,,,10
4,2047,2,Humans always think that power and money can buy them anything. But that's not the case with love.,You are right!,How do you know when you've found true love?,I make it my mission to ruin love rooted in greed. Will you stay at my side and help?,"You know its true love when you're willing to give up everything for it, including the power to rule the world.",,,,,10
5,2047,1,Are you good at archery?,I'm very good at that!,Uh...not very good.,Really? That's great! I'm a bit tired of being the god of love and need a break. I'm looking for someone to take my place for a while,"Do you want me to give you private lessons? Just grab my hand and draw back the bowstring. ...Oh, why is your other hand touching me there?",,,,,10
6,2047,2,Being a god of love is also quite boring. I also want to have an unforgettable date!,Are you free tonight?,Who do you want to date?,I wasn't expecting you to ask me so suddenly! I don't know what to say...,"Anyone would be fine... Although, a date with you would be nice.",,,,,10
7,2039,1,I like lilies very much. It can symbolize purity and loyalty more than ever in the world.,It really suits you.,I like it too.,"That's just the way it is! No matter how pleasant your words are, I won't be happy with the praise from mortals!","You are different from those who love flowers with beautiful colors, which surprised me a lot..",,,,,10
8,2039,5,"According to prophecy, I will marry a very powerful person who lusts after women.",Fate can be changed.,You can't deny fate.,It seems that you are a person who does not believe in fate. It has been a long time since no mortal dared to fight against fate.,"For your sake, you better hope that person isn't you. Whoever I marry will suffer horribly.",,,,,10
9,2039,3,"Want to visit my private garden? Even if the end of the world comes, I have a quiet place of my own.",I feel very honored!,Will it bother you?,There's no one else here. Just relax and enjoy this time alone together.,"Although there are only two of us! But this is just a personal invitation, don't think too much!",,,,,10
10,2039,1,The flames of war give my flowers an especially attractive glow.,I hope you are merciful.,I wish you good luck and prosperity.,"I'm never soft on the battlefield. But if you want me to treat the enemy with kindness, I won't object.",Haha... Many people have already said this to me and followed me onto the battlefield. Would you like to know their stories?,,,,,10
11,2039,4,"Since I lost my divine power and memory, it seems that the whole world doesn't care about me anymore.",At least I care.,The world is always cruel.,What are you talking about! I don't... don't care if a mortal admires me!,"Haha...Yes, what this world prizes power. Would you help me regain some of my power by serving as my sword and shield?",,,,,10
12,2039,5,Mortals are pitifully weak. Yet history has proven their resilience time and time again.,I am also a mortal.,Unity is strength.,You are different from everyone else! You are the only one I have ever admired. That is why I have chosen you and only you.,"The gods are always fighting amongst themselves. Yet, I'm astounded that you have managed to unite even opposing gods under one banner.",,,,,10
13,2049,4,I still have a fear of flying. Maybe I should give up using these wings?,You need to face your fears.,Giving up is not a bad thing.,You're right. I will continue trying to overcome my fear.,Whether or not I can fly doesn't matter. Seeing you gives me courage.,,,,,10
14,2049,5,"According to some, ignorant people are often fearless. Do you agree that bravery is rooted in ignorance?",There may be some truth to that.,"If so, such bravery seems reckless.","I think so, too. When heroes know they might fall in battle, it can fill them with fear.","Yes, sometimes that is true. But such recklessness comes at a heavy cost.",,,,,10
15,2049,1,"Truth is deceptively alluring. Though we know we will never understand it, we still pursue it with voracious curiosity.",Wisdom can only be found in truth.,It's not bad to be naive.,"Unfortunately, my bravery precludes such wisdom, for I rarely think things through. I am often blinded by my confidence.","Some things grow more confusing the more you think about them. Regardless, it is still good to ponder such things.",,,,,10
16,2049,3,Wonderful art is like an clever invention. Both are products of great imagination and creativity. Don't you agree?,Exactly.,Can you give an example?,"Therefore, a good artist should also be a good inventor. I always dream to be such a person!",My artificial wings are a spectacularly beautiful invention! Aren't they the perfect example of artistic invention?,,,,,10
17,2049,2,"Sculpture is a passion of mine. No matter my mood, it always calms me down.",I want to see your works!,Can you teach me that?,"My sculptures are a private affair since they are all body art based on myself. But for you, I'll make an exception.","Sculpture is best learned on your own, though I would be happy to be your model!",,,,,10
18,2049,5,I still can't figure out what distinguishes gods from the rest of creation...,The level of ability?,Their longevity?,Not necessarily. I have seen many human heroes in Greece. They are fully strong enough to compete with gods on the battlefield!,"There are many monsters and demons whose lifespans are nearly eternal, but they don't seem to be gods either.",,,,,10
19,2055,2,Do you like snowy winters?,"Yes, I love it!",It's too cold!,I'm pleased that you enjoy that season. The cold often brings an icy calm to the land.,"People often associate cold with death. However, snow and ice are part of the world, and they are eternal.",,,,,10
20,2055,2,"I used to spend a long time in my lair, and no one can understand that feeling of loneliness...","Actually, I can.",You are no longer alone.,"Many great human heroes have faced like this. They are surrounded by countless glory, but they are never understood by others.","I never thought I would be interested in a human being, but the days with you seem to be quite interesting.",,,,,10
21,2055,2,"I don't agree with war, because war will always bring endless disasters to this world...",I don't agree either.,There is always a reason for war.,"Fortunately you think so. What the world needs is rationality and order, not chaos and destruction.",But most of the reasons are unreasonable. I hope you can calmly think about the meaning of every battle like me.,,,,,10
22,2055,1,Want to know my sisters of the same race? They seem to have awakened in this disaster.,You mean the Ember Dragon?,You mean the Storm Dragon?,"She is the worst-tempered of our three sisters. She is very anxious but enthusiastic and refreshing, and she has a good relationship with humans.","She has the brightest mind of our three sisters. There have been many bounty hunters to fight against her, but none of them have come back...",,,,,10
23,2055,5,Humans are eager for eternal life like gods. This is actually not difficult to do. Do you want to try it?,I want to give it a try!,Uh... forget it.,"The method is very simple. Freeze yourself, then you can have eternal youth like me. Isn't this wonderful?","Wise decision. Mankind may be able to obtain eternal life, but it may pay a greater price for it...",,,,,10
24,2055,2,Most humans think that I am just a cold and merciless god. Do you think so too?,I don't think so.,Have a guess.,Strange guy... Maybe this is why I am willing to open my heart in front of you...,"I don't know...but so far, no one will accompany me like you all the time...",,,,,10
25,2050,3,You seem to be available. Would you like to spend a long night with this lonely lady?,Do you mean a date?,"Uh, I'm afraid I have other things to do.","Oh! So direct! ...But yes, it would be a date. I hope to share a lovely evening with you. We could make many pleasant memories.",Hmm... let me guess... You already have plans with another girl?,,,,,10
26,2050,3,Is it really that important for someone to tell the truth?,Of course!,I don't like to be lied to.,"Since I created the world, I haven't seen many humans tell the truth. It's a pity.",Oh really? So... I love you. But is that the truth or a lie? Take a guess.,,,,,10
27,2050,1,Do you prefer day or night?,Day.,Night.,"I envy humans for the time they spend in the afternoon sun, whether it be shopping, sunbathing, or strolling through the park with a lover.",The night is full of mystery. It is the perfect time for two lovers to be alone... Anyway... Are you free tonight?,,,,,10
28,2050,1,"In my opinion, humans worry too much about good and evil when deciding how to act. What really matters their intention and conviction.",I think kindness is most important.,Conviction demonstrates strength!,"Oh, really? Then we'll see if your kindness can save us from the disaster that's engulfed the world.",That's pleasing to hear. I prefer strong individuals.,,,,,10
29,2050,1,"When faced with a difficult decision, do you rely more on intuition or rational analysis?",I rely more on intuition.,I follow reason more.,"If you follow your instincts, what sort of trouble will the two of us get into tonight when we're alone in our room?","You may be calm and rational now, but we'll see how long that lasts in the presence of my seductive charm.",,,,,10
30,2050,2,"Movies are one of the most wonderful inventions of human civilization. Do you love watching movies? Which do you prefer, comedy or tragedy?",I prefer comedy.,I prefer tragedy.,"Not surprising. The world is already full of tragedy. ...And speaking of tragedies, I hope you can stop the disaster that's engulfing the world today.",I'm shocked! Just don't watch too many of them. I don't want them to make you pessimistic.,,,,,10

32,2062,2,"I am not afraid of this war, I hope to end it with you.",As you wish.,I will face it alone.,"Thank you for your trust in me all the time, and I will protect your back on the deadly battlefield.",Then at least allow me to pray to the moon for your safety every night before the war is over.,,,,,10
33,2062,1,"I like gentle animals like rabbits very much, how about you?","Me, too.",Just so so...,They like to get close to humans very much. They are so lovable guys...,"Hmm... With your personality, you might prefer some fierce and wild guys, right?",,,,,10
34,2062,4,"If one day, I have to go back to the moon, would you like to go with me?","Yes, I'd love to.",I'm afraid not……,"After this war is over, let's go back to my hometown together, where there will never be apocalypse and disaster.","I understand that you are in this world, maybe there are things you can never give up...",,,,,10
35,2062,5,"I actually don't want to be a god, because eternal life is too heavy for me...",But it is fate.,Mortals also have troubles.,I should be grateful for meeting you. Maybe this is the greatest comfort that fate has given a lonely person.,Mortal people sigh for the short life. How can they understand the eternal loneliness...,,,,,10
36,2062,1,"It's a boring and deserted night. When I was lonely in the past, I would always sing a nursery rhyme to relieve boredom.",I want to hear you sing.,Do you want me to sing it to you?,"Then lie down on my lap, close your eyes and listen quietly. Wish you a good night...","Well, if it were you, I would be happy to listen.",,,,,10

38,2051,2,"As long as I can fight, the enemy will never set foot inside the city gate.",I will be with you.,I believe in your power.,You are very reassuring.,"So far, I have never let my Nordic companions down.",,,,,10
39,2051,2,There is always someone we want to protect. This is true for everyone.,Who do you want to protect?,Exactly.,"I refuse to answer, but... you will know in the future…","Then, what about you? Who do you want to protect?",,,,,10
40,2051,2,Have you heard of Ragnarok?,Yes.,Not really.,I swear... Never let this happen again in this world.,"Well, that's ok, you don't want to know how tragic the disaster was...",,,,,10
41,2051,4,You almost died in the previous battle! How can you be so reckless!,Sorry to have worried you.,The brave always have good luck.,I wasn't worried. I was just... pointing it out.,"If you don't have my protection next time, then don't take risks like that again!",,,,,10
42,2051,2,I'm afraid it will be difficult to recover the divine power I lost...,Don't give up.,I will guard you.,What do you mean... Are you willing to regain my strength with me?,You fool...,,,,,10
43,2053,2,"You are too young to be a ruler! If I were you, I'd be desperate to gain experience and mature as quickly as possible.",I will do my best!,Success should not be rush!,You remind me of my youth. It was nice to reminisce on ages past.,I'm glad you're not short-tempered like me. Maybe you're a more suitable commander than I am.,,,,,10
44,2053,2,I see little distinction between gods and mortals. Gods are just more powerful versions of humans.,I agree with you.,"But gods are immortal, and humans are not.","Therefore, as long as human beings continuously hone themselves, one day they will be able to reach the mighty state of gods!","When it comes to eternal life, humans can achieve it either through prayer or magic.

46,2053,1,"Do you think it is weird for a miko, or shrine maiden, to wear a samurai costume?",Not at all!,It's kind of strange...,"It's not weird to me either. It's the meaning behind it that's important. A miko must not only be wise and reverent, but she must also have the will of a samurai!",You won't think it strange when I prove to you on the battlefield that I am also a qualified warrior with an indomitable will!,,,,,10
47,2053,2,"Ever since I was reincarnated in this world, I have spent each day thinking about eventually restoring the country of Yamatai.",I will always support you!,Do not tangle in the past.,I knew I could trust you! I look forward to seeing your talent and courage as a ruler!,"If anyone else said this, I would never agree. I don't know why, but I always think you're right.",,,,,10
48,2053,3,Do you think I am too serious for a woman? Does it make me less feminine?,Not at all!,Do you care?,"Good, because even the most feminine woman can have a strong and commanding side to her personality!","When I'm with you, I worry about it more than I should admit.",,,,,10
49,2057,2,"The more powerful the force, the more dangerous it is, and so is the storm...",I will stay away from the storm.,I will control the storm.,"Unlike most humans, you are more rational than I thought, and maybe it is a correct decision to cooperate with you.",Really? You are the 147th human to say this. Guess the fate of the last 146 guys?,,,,,10
50,2057,2,"Only wisdom can control powerful forces, not anger. How do you think of it?",You are right.,I do not think so……,"I am very pleased to hear that you agree with my point of view, maybe you really have the ability to become the leader of the gods.","Anger will only make your head hot, but if you can control your own anger, you may also have powerful power.",,,,,10
51,2057,2,"The war is simply boring. With the time for fighting and killing, it is better to study others.",War also brings progress.,I agree with your philosophy.,"In a way, you are right. After defeating the group of idiots who came to crusade against me, my strength has indeed improved a lot.",So how long will it take you to end this world war between the gods?,,,,,10
52,2057,1,Two sisters of my family seem to have awakened with this disaster...Although it was also in my expectation...,You mean the Ember Dragon?,You mean Frost Dragon?,"It's not a good thing for this grumpy guy to wake up. Surprisingly, she gets along well with humans...","If you're fine, don't mess with her. If she is in a bad mood, you may be frozen in ice for the rest of your life...",,,,,10
53,2057,2,Why do humans and gods like to entangle their identities so much... Gods and humans are indistinguishable from me.,Why do you say that?,I think so.,"God also has birth and destruction, and he also needs to follow the rules of the world. God is not the truth, but just a strong existence.","In my opinion, only those who want to become gods would say this. It seems that you are also an ambitious guy...",,,,,10
54,2057,3,"Although I regard you as a competitor, I have to admit that I have a good impression of you...",me too!,I was surprised!,"In addition to competitors. I am looking forward to the relationship with you in the future, that... a deeper relationship can also be...","You are too slow! We have been working together for so long, haven't you noticed it...",,,,,10
55,2056,1,Ah...it's so boring! ! I really want to find a strong one to fight! !,I will be your opponent?,Are you in the next battle?,"no problem! This time I won't be like the last time, because I lost to you carelessly!",Is it finally my turn to play? ! Wait to see me burn the enemy into a barbecue! Hahaha!,,,,,10
56,2056,3,"Are you asking about what I would do when I met an enemy? Of course, first persuade him to surrender! Roast him without surrendering!",It was unexpectedly scary...,It's unexpectedly reasonable.,Do I look like a merciful person? ! Nothing excites me more than defeating an enemy!,"Even if it is a monster, it must be given a chance to solve the problem peacefully, although it is useless most of the time.",,,,,10
57,2056,5,"War is no different from a game. It's just who gets out first, what do you think?",As you said.,I disagree.,"As your companion, I am very happy to hear you, the commander-in-chief, agree with me, hum...","It's no surprise that when I stepped onto the battlefield of this world, I had no longer any nostalgia for life.",,,,,10
58,2056,1,"Hmm... I noticed that the two sisters, just like me, have also awakened in this world...",You mean the Storm Dragon?,You mean Frost Dragon?,"She is a wise and strategic guy, but if you really want to fight, she will definitely not be able to beat me!","That cold guy is so boring, I can't stay by her side for a second!",,,,,10
59,2056,5,"The reason why God owns the place not because he is powerful, but he has extraordinary courage and determination to die on the battlefield!",You are right!,What you think is too simple.,"Therefore, as the commander of the gods, you must have courage stronger than them!","Thinking too complicated is meaningless. Without courage, how do you face the difficulties and fears on the way to becoming a god?",,,,,10
60,2056,1,Human cooking is really interesting. I have begun to understand the meaning of the phrase civilization begins with flames.,Can you cook too?,Which dishes do you like?,Didn't expect it? ! My craftsmanship is not inferior to your top human chefs!,"Hmm... let me think... I like most of the dishes, but of course, the roast meats are my favorite! !",,,,,10
61,2032,2,"It seems that even if I spared no effort, it is still difficult to make the sun of this world shine again...",There is no need to blame yourself.,We will encounter it together.,"Indeed. Self-blame has no significance. As a symbol of light and hope, I need to cheer up again!","You are right...Even if you were once the ruler of the sun, you still need to face the end of the world with your companions.",,,,,10
62,2032,2,"I often recalled the days when I was in Takamagahara. Although there were constant troubles, they enriched my life.",People need to face the future.,Memories bring determination.,"Sorry, I seem to be over-indulged in the passing time. I hope it didn't bother you.","As you said, people expect to find a peaceful life like in the past, so we must end this disaster!",,,,,10
63,2032,2,Why do people have to use war to solve problems and contradictions? Doesn't this make the matter worse?,You are right.,"But in fact, it's not.","Anyway, I always believe that differences in ideas can be unified in a more peaceful way, not war.","I can understand the dilemma that needs to be resolved immediately in a crisis, but I still hope that you treat every war with caution.",,,,,10
64,2032,2,"After going through this disaster, I must revive the former glory of Yamato god pedigree and bring peace to the gods!",This is very exciting.,That sounds like a heavy burden.,"At that time, the Yamato gods will take the responsibility of maintaining peace, so the re will be no disputes anymore.",But I will definitely complete this mission. Do you feel it? That's why destiny made me come to this world.,,,,,10
65,2032,5,Your clothes were damaged badly in the battle... Do you want me to make you a new one?,Thank you.,That's somewhat embarrassing...,"Although I live in a different era from you, I am very confident in my skills in spinning and designing clothes!","Although when I measure your height and measurements, you need to be frank with me, I think our relationship should be fine for that...",,,,,10
66,2048,2,"Mortal people always fear death. In my opinion, death means tranquility free from emotion and eternal beauty...",I do not agree.,I agree.,"Haha, when a person feels no fear of death, he will no longer have any weaknesses. You will soon understand...",You are the most rational mortal I have ever met. Our future cooperation may become more interesting...,,,,,10
67,2048,2,"Whoever it is, it is god or mortal, everyone needs to face the fate of destruction and vanishing...",Exactly.,The strong will challenge fate.,"Therefore, no matter it is mortal or gods, they should follow fate while they are alive and prepare for death...","Oh, really? I would like to see if you, as the spokesperson of death, can escape from me...",,,,,10
68,2048,5,Why do people always call my strategy a conspiracy? Is there any difference between good and evil in fighting strategies?,I think there is no difference.,I think there is a difference.,"A wise answer. A strategy is just a strategy, to differ them as good or evil is just a kind of rhetoric and excuse.",It seems that you are different from me. You are more willing to use your fists and strength to resolve conflicts... Should I praise your sense of glory?,,,,,10
69,2048,2,I never deny that I am a careerist. This messy world is so in need of order and unity!,Order comes from the strong!,Order comes from rules.,"You are right, but unfortunately, this sentence is only valid when the strong man is alive...","Oh, it's hard to believe that I would hear this from mortals. That's right, you will find that death is the fairest rule in the world.",,,,,10
70,2048,2,Is glory such an important thing to a soldier?,At least I think it is.,It is not important.,Yes...see how many heroes lost their lives for glory. Death in this way is also an art...,"Death will erase everything. Whatever how great the glory was made by the hero, it will fade away with the passing of admirers...",,,,,10
71,2031,2,Death is not horrible. What's terrible is that you have regrets for your life when you die.,Life is not perfect.,I have no regrets at all!,Look at your reaction...do you think that the biggest regret in life is the lack of a girl's company?,"Well, look at the girls around you, see how they admire you. You really have no regrets in your life.",,,,,10
72,2031,1,"Monsters are rampant in the underworld recently, which is very bad. Do you have time to solve the trouble with me together?",I bet it's a mission with no return.,No problem!,"With your strong power, you will return from any dangerous place. Of course, it is another matter of which way you come back, whether it is standing or lying down...","Hmm... you'd better put on the thickest armor before you leave, otherwise I don't guarantee that you will come back completely...",,,,,10
73,2031,1,Are you interested in judging the dead with me?,Yes!,It seems a little scary...,"You made a sensible choice! When you go on my trial after you die, I promise you will know more...","Don't worry, it's much more fun than you think...especially when you kick the nasty guy down the abyss...",,,,,10
74,2031,2,War is meaningless. Destiny will not be changed just by a war...,War is only a method.,"But in fact, it's not.",I don't feel repulsion for war. The dead people caused by war can make my lonely palace bustling for months...,"Well, let's make a bet and see if this doomsday can end with the war you lead.",,,,,10
75,2031,5,"As a mortal, what do you think of me as a god of death?",Super handsome and charming!,A bit scary……,"Uh-hum, are you free tonight? Are you interested in experiencing the charming side of the god of death in my room?",It really disappoints me. It seems that I need to punish you tonight who doesn't understand the romance...,,,,,10
76,2025,2,"War is an act of harming nature, and I will prevent it at any time.",Nature also has a temper.,I agree with you.,"Nature does sometimes bring disasters, but this is a destiny directed by heaven, not a man-made disaster.","Although you often fight on the battlefield, I know that everything you do is to end the war as soon as possible.",,,,,10
77,2025,2,"It often takes several years to repair the cracks in the heavens, which needs to be patient...",I am impatient sometimes.,I am always patient!,I hope you don't get too impatient when you get along with girls. Girls get angry even more terrible than the heaven cracks...,"Oh, is it? Then you must be very good at chasing girls. It takes a lot of patience to get along with girls...",,,,,10
78,2025,2,Conforming to nature is the most reasonable behavior. Everything and every rule in the world are originated from nature.,Let nature take its course.,People should control nature.,"I am very pleased that you can agree. Everything has a destiny, and nature controls them all the time.","I certainly don't think other people can succeed, but if it is you... maybe there is a small possibility.",,,,,10
79,2025,1,"Although I have lost part of my divine power, I don't regret it. It's just that nature needs me to return the power to it.",Do you want to regain your divine power?,I will always guard you!,"I appreciate your kindness, but there is no need to do so, because this is the destiny that nature wants me to face.",Haha... No mortal has ever said something like this to me...Do you know what it means?,,,,,10
80,2025,1,Do you ask me about my hobbies? I think I like raising cute animals and growing flowers.,It seems a little flat...,Very elegant interest!,"Believe me, after experiencing countless adventures and excitement, you will feel that dull life is a kind of enjoyment.",Do you think so too?!

82,2052,1,"Do you want to know heaven? It seems to be nothing special for me, but at least there won't be any evil.",Hope to go there and have a look.,What about hell?,"I can send you to heaven right now, but there is no return. Do you want to have a try?","I don't know, but judging from the screams from the sulfur fiery pits of hell every day, it should be a very exciting place.",,,,,10
83,2052,2,"War is the fastest way to destroy evil, but not the best way...",Why do you say that?,What is the best way?,Do you think it is really the devil who destroys this world?

290,2073,1,Are you fond of pets? Do you like keeping a lovely pet fish?,You're quite cute!,It needs patience and skills.,I knew you were gonna say that...Eh?! Wait!

294,2074,2,"At this time, it's still difficult for the world to accept the fact that god and humans would fall in love, just because the identity of god is different from that of humans.",It's definitely a pity...,I don't care about identity differences.,"Anyway, I still look forward to one day when we all throw off our identity and pursue our true love.",You are more optimistic than I thought...May you be able to change this old world and reshape the relationship between humans and God.,,,,,10
295,2074,2,"Was the kid, Cupid, faithful to her obligation before I came to this world?",She really did a great job.,She doesn't seem to do well.,I'm so surprised! I thought that she would screw up affection affairs in this world with her personality.,"Aha...It's met my expectations. If she was qualified enough, I won't be summoned to this world.",,,,,10
296,2074,1,Are you fond of artwork?

300,2075,3,Do you think there is an insurmountable distance between God and man after all?,I'm afraid so.,I don't think so.,"Maybe it is what it is.

337,2081,1,What is your first impression of the God of ancient Egypt?,Full of mystery.,Beautiful and dignified.,"Being mysterious will prevent the enemy from knowing your next moves! But I don't have to hide in front of you, right?","This is a very high compliment, and I like it.",,,,,10
338,2081,1,Why do people always feel that charm cannot coexist with power?,Maybe it's because they fear the one who has it all.,"Because they haven't met you, the embodiment of both charm and power.",Is that so? Then they are being narrowminded. My power is used to protect my people.,Is that so? Well I am confident in both my charm and my power.,,,,,10
339,2082,1,"Of the two most charming goddesses of the Nordic region, who would you favor more, Freyja or me?","Of course, it’s you!",Hmm... want to take a guess?,"Really? Is that the truth, or are you lying?","Hmm, you seem to hesitate. Would you rather become fertilizer in my rose garden.",,,,,10
340,2082,5,Nordic gods often say love involves blind sacrifices. Is that so?,I don’t think it necessarily is.,I really think so.,But isn’t love without sacrifice less genuine?,"So, what would you sacrifice for me?",,,,,10
341,2082,1,I heard that watering roses with the blood of a loved one bestows them with powerful magic…,I’ve heard such rumors as well!,It sounds like a myth to me.,So guess what exciting thing I am about to do next…,Interesting! Shall we test it?,,,,,10
342,2082,1,I enjoy watching things wilt. The end result reminds me of roses smashed by a hammer. Beauty can be found even in its own destruction.,Thor would probably feel the same.,That sounds a bit disturbing…,"As a child, she enjoyed playing with me. I taught her a lot about wielding a hammer.","Hmph, after witnessing me pulverizing monsters on the battlefield, I believe you would understand.",,,,,10
343,2082,3,"I’ve heard that Venus has quite some views on love, I’d like to meet her.",I have a bad feeling about this…,Maybe that’s a good idea.,"As a child, she enjoyed playing with me. I taught her a lot about wielding a hammer.","I think so too, at least as a goddess of love, she would understand my philosophy of love.",,,,,10
344,2082,2,"I love adorable and beautiful things, so much that I want to crush them all…",Have you ever looked in the mirror?,Er… the same goes for me?,"Are you asking if I’ve had the same thought about myself? Indeed, I have…","You guessed it. I indeed want to hold you tight in my arms, relishing in your slow suffocation…",,,,,10
345,2083,2,"The legions of Sparta will, under my leadership, conquer all of Greece sooner or later!",I doubt Athena would see it that way.,Do you need my assistance?,"I couldn't care less about her. If she still considers herself a warrior, she should face me in open battle!","Hmph, you may not look like much of a fighter, but I respect your courage and determination as a warrior.",,,,,10
346,2083,2,"As a formidable warrior, one must train at least twelve hours a day!",And what about the rest of the time?,Isn't that a bit excessive?,"Off to the tavern for a drink, or perhaps to the arena for a brawl. Of course, marching with my army to give Athena a little shock wouldn't be too bad either.","Trust me, once you've faced setbacks on the battlefields of Troy, you wouldn't think that way.",,,,,10
347,2083,1,"One day, I'll prove to everyone that Ares is the only one deserving of the title 'God of War'.",Are you that concerned with a title?,I believe you'll achieve it in time.,"Of course! Titles represent honor, and honor is the only true testament of a warrior's existence.","Hmph, you have a good eye. With someone as wise and brave as you by my side, it won't take long to dominate all the pantheons.",,,,,10
348,2083,1,"I must have the final say in everything, even in love. It should be on my terms!",Do you even understand the meaning of love?,Perhaps you're right.,"Ah, that's quite the question. I think it'd be best discussed with you, privately in a room tonight...","Of course, all my lover needs to do is lay in my arms or lean on my shoulder.",,,,,10
349,2083,1,"Once, during a showcase in the realm of the gods, when it was my turn, I went on stage and brawled with every guest.",That's hardly a performance.,That must have been quite the spectacle...,"Really? Well, what else would you expect the God of War to showcase apart from fighting?",The highlight? I personally gave Hera a 'new hairstyle'.,,,,,10
350,2083,1,Hahaha! Do you think there's a need for a signature victory pose for my warriors?,Doesn't seem necessary.,Absolutely! I'd love to see that!,"Hmm, you might be right. After all, the valor of our warriors already leaves a lasting impression on our foes.","How about this? After a victory, they shout 'This is Sparta!' and then kick the enemy away. How's that for an idea?",,,,,10
351,2084,2,Don't you think quietly appreciating a dancer's graceful feet is a unique pleasure?,Exactly.,I don’t think so…,What I'm looking forward to more is the day you will help me put on my dance shoes…,Really? Then tell me... where is your gaze settling on me now?,,,,,10
352,2084,2,"All gods pursue power and authority, but I’m just a dancer. All I seek is to pursue the pinnacle of dance skills.",I like you for being so pure.,Dancers also need to protect themselves.,"I like this version of myself too. After all, power and authority ultimately fade with time.","I believe that when faced with danger, you will protect me, won't you?",,,,,10
353,2084,1,"Ever since the day we crossed paths, I've been itching to be by your side...",I hope for that too.,I don't want to be a burden to you.,"Then maybe I should slow down, in both battles and in our life, so you can keep up with my pace.","If this 'burden' can bring me happiness, then it's not a bad thing, don't you think?",,,,,10
354,2084,1,How do you view the rulers of the divine realm and the underworld?,There's not much difference between the two...,At least the gods have principles.,Hmm... I agree. What the gods do is essentially just satisfying their own desires.,"However, I've encountered many demons, and they are also very honorable. At least, they won't treat me differently because of my identity.",,,,,10
355,2084,1,"I don't wish for the gods to impose eternal imprisonment on sinners. After all, there's hardly a sin that cannot be forgiven...",It's rare to hear you think this way.,I don't think so.,"Hmm... because compared to the pain of eternal imprisonment, death might be a kind of release","Perhaps, but those sentenced to eternal imprisonment are not easy to deal with...",,,,,10
356,2084,1,"As a hybrid of god and demon, do you think I resemble an angel... or a demon more?",You look quite demonic.,You're still an Angel at heart.,"Ah, I see. It seems I need to prove that notion to you tonight..","Is that so? Well, maybe after spending a night with me tonight, you might change your mind.",,,,,10
357,2085,1,Yay! The beautiful sea! Can't wait to slip into the brand-new swimsuit I just bought!,Did you buy a new swimsuit? Again?,Are you a good swimmer?,Yeah! Shall I get you one?

358,2085,1,You know what?! It turns out West Dragons have not only tails and horns but also a pair of wings!,Are you just realizing that?,Do you fly without wings?,I thought all the Dragons in the world were just like us.,"Absolutely no! As Eastern Dragons, we rely on our magical power to soar through the sky.",,,,,10
359,2085,2,"Drizzling rain adorns the flowers anew,A thunderclap awakens the creatures too.Farmers at ease, days of leisure,Plowing and sowing, a new round of pleasure...",Is this a poem praying for the harvest?,What's the meaning of the poem you just recited?,"Well, yeah... In my hometown, people often place their hopes for a year of prosperity on the blessings of good weather.",Come on! Give it a shot! I bet you can figure out what that means with your brilliant mind...,,,,,10
360,2085,1,"Listen up, I'll have you know! I once held the prestigious title of the Water Deity, protecting a realm!","The Water Deity, protecting a realm?",Do you have your Deity position?,The Green Valleys in the East Continent is the place where I cultivated my skills.,"Of course! With the blessings of the Water Deity, the land thrives in harmony, ensuring that people are well-fed. It is I who have the power to make it!",,,,,10
361,2085,3,"I accidentally lost the Dragon Ball! Now I'm stranded in the Heavenly Realm, with no way back to the Dragon Palace.",Do you need the Dragon Ball to go back to the Dragon Palace?,I think the Heavenly Realm is quite good...,"The Dragon Ball is like a pass, it is the only guide for the Eastern Dragons to find their way back to the Dragon Palace.","Well, at least with you around, I believe the days will be pretty good.",,,,,10
362,2085,5,Do you have any wishes you want to make come true in the new year?,Hmm... To be with you forever?,Hmm... I want to be luckier!,"W- What are you talking about? But with my Devine Power, fulfilling this wish should not be a problem at all...",Heh heh... That's easy! All you need to do is one thing: keep the lucky me by your side at all times!,,,,,10
363,2086,5,Are you afraid of death?,"Yes, of course. After all, who doesn't want to live their life to the fullest?",No. All things tangible must die eventually.,"Nevertheless, that's how the world works. It is inconceivable for anyone to endure an everlasting existence in this world.","Ha... Individuals like you, who possess such wisdom, have become a rare sight in this age that has long surpassed the reign of gods...",,,,,10
364,2086,5,Is it true that the Norse god of death was once perceived as a dark and fearsome figure in the hearts of humans?,That's not the case.,Maybe yes.,Is that so? I've always been concerned that I appear overly serious.,"Do young people these days truly have a preference for that sort of cool, unapproachable image resembling the god of death?",,,,,10
365,2086,5,"No offense, but is it true that mortal conflicts have now been waged within these devices called cell phones?","Times have changed, ma'am.",At least there is no need to worry about safety.,"Can one really attain glory in such a manner? If one were to perish to battle within this realm, would their soul still be granted entry into the Valhalla?","Oh, it's quite amusing how humans are naturally inclined towards a bit of fighting. If indulging their craving for conquest can be satisfied through such a method, it might not be a bad thing.",,,,,10

It's a small stage that encapsulates the vastness of history.,I like it too!,I'm not a fan of it...,Depicting a story in the form of music is truly a magical and beautiful way of storytelling.,"I can comprehend your viewpoint. After all, for many individuals, this form of performance is considered outdated.",,,,,10
367,2086,2,"At times, I ponder why, if life demands the eternal cycle of birth and death, one is not bestowed immortality from the very inception?",Perhaps the soul requires reincarnation for cleansing.,Perhaps it is an oversight on the part of the Creator.,You are correct. The experiences of a hundred years can leave the soul weary beyond measure. Perhaps reincarnation can cleanse the pain within their hearts.,The Creator wouldn't commit such a blunder. She has designed it this way for a purpose.,,,,,10
368,2086,2,"Are you here to seek knowledge? My study holds the wisdom of countless scholars throughout the ages, spanning hundreds of years.","Yes, I presume wisdom.",Um... I'd rather go to a pub.,"Very few humans are willing to spend centuries seeking the truth, but you, on the other hand, are quite an exception...","Well, looks like you don't need to leave after all. Because, after the sun sets, this place becomes more enchanting than any ordinary pub you can find...",,,,,10
369,2087,5,Humans always think Titan means everything is big. What do you think about that?,I totally agree!,"Clearly, Titan doesn't mean that.","Interesting answer... My next question is, where were your eyes focused when you answered me just now?","Well, it seems you're more conservative than I thought, haha...",,,,,10
370,2087,2,"Truth is like a beacon in the wind, only through self-sacrifice can it be preserved.","Indeed, truth cannot be extinguished.","Yet, this implies sacrifice.","As you say, however, I have witnessed too many attempts to suppress truth, both in the past and present.","Exactly, even if we fall in pursuit of truth, there will be others who follow in our footsteps.",,,,,10
371,2087,2,"Reason and emotion, the eternal loop of creation, the perpetual speculation...",What if there were no emotions?,And what if there were no reason?,"Well, people would turn into lifeless machines, and this place would become a dull, lifeless world.","Heh, then we'd probably be just a few days away from the next brawl in the divine realm!",,,,,10
372,2087,4,"During my days of imprisonment by Zeus, I was quite bored, so bored that I ended up naming every star in the sky.",Would you like to tell me about it?,Every single star?,"If you have the time, I'd be delighted to invite you to my room and spend the whole night slowly telling you their names...","Yep, but for mortals, it's probably best not to do the same, or before you know it, you'll likely need glasses!",,,,,10
373,2087,1,I enjoy attending parties with Hephaestus because she always manages to find common ground with me.,What does she like to talk about?,What do you like to talk about?,"She often discusses how instead of focusing on making flames brighter, we should think about how to warm people's hearts...","I always ask her if she has any ideas that can make someone's heart race, and then I let her guess who I'm planning to use it on.",,,,,10
374,2087,1,"So, Zeus has started decorating her palace with candles and torches now? I remember when the Primordial Flame was born, she was afraid of burning down the divine realm.","As a king of the gods, one should be a bit more cautious.","That's overly cautious, isn't it?",Forget it! I bet now she looks forward to a wild fireworks show every night.,"Absolutely, she was so worried about fire being too dangerous back then, she ended up eating cold bread for half a year...",,,,,10
375,2088,2,"Do you believe that fate has destined us to walk a certain path, even if that path does not lead to the destination we desire?",We are not bound by fate.,Perhaps that is indeed the case.,I agree… The choice to grant the power to change everything may very well be what shapes our future.,"Even though each of us may seem like a speck of dust in the grand scheme of fate, within that speck, countless possibilities exist.",,,,,10
376,2088,3,"When two people are fearless in giving for each other, it is no longer just a simple promise, but a contract of souls.",Promises are indeed important.,Promises can sometimes feel heavy…,"As you said, once a promise becomes a pact, it transcends time and space, becoming an eternal part of our lives.","A pact is the deepest form of promise. While it burdens us, it also gives us endless strength.",,,,,10
377,2088,2,"There is too much pain in the world, but every act of redemption injects new hope into it.",You’re right.,It’s not easy to hold on.,"I believe that these little bits of power, like sunlight, though seemingly fragile, can melt even the hardest ice and snow.","Whether it’s easy or not is not important. What matters is that every little effort, at some point, will come together to form true light.",,,,,10
378,2088,1,"Even the most merciless have a softer side, and when they seek repentance, perhaps what we can offer is simply forgiveness.",I agree with you.,"Forgiveness isn’t the same as indulgence, is it?",Forgiveness gives people the courage to face their own weaknesses. Only by accepting our weaknesses can we find the strength to rise again.,"Forgiveness is not unconditional pardoning; it’s choosing to give others a chance to change, even when the mistake is clear.",,,,,10
379,2088,1,"I often imagine a world without war. Though it feels distant, belief will eventually bring this era to fruition.",Belief is indeed a powerful force.,I’m not as confident as you are…,"Faith guides us, telling us that no matter how far we go, we will eventually reach that ideal destination.","Doubt is human nature, but each step we take in persistence adds one more piece to the puzzle of the world we dream of.",,,,,10

At least, your unwavering companionship is the most perfect thing for me.",,,,,10
381,2089,1,Food is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Especially those spicy flavors… they remind me of prey struggling to escape.,Uh… I’m not really a fan of spicy food.,Exactly.,Oh? So you prefer milder flavors? That’s a bit unexpected…,"Is that so? Darling, don’t you ever wonder what it feels like to be the prey for once?",,,,,10
382,2089,2,"Humans have such expressive faces… sometimes, your eyes are far more honest than your words.",Can you tell what I’m thinking?,I highly doubt that…,Hmm… I’ll keep it a secret for now.

I’m not a fan of flashy, attention-grabbing trips either.","I can tell you’re someone who needs company. So, here’s the real question—who would you choose as your companion? Heh…",,,,,10
384,2089,5,Do you know much about music? What kind of tunes do you like?,"I’m more drawn to deep, soulful melodies.","I love music with a strong, powerful rhythm.","Same here. Deep, flowing melodies feel like the wind weaving through a forest… so calming and peaceful.","You love moving freely to the rhythm, don’t you? Care to share a dance with me?",,,,,10
385,2089,5,What’s your take on the idea of being a “cold-blooded creature”?,A kind of graceful silence.,A wisdom born from survival.,"Graceful silence… what an interesting way to put it. But I must say, I quite like that.",Wisdom for survival? Maybe. But don’t you think life could use a dash of emotion to spice things up?,,,,,10
386,2089,5,I’m more curious about what kinds of books humans enjoy reading than about myself.,Books about pursuing knowledge and truth.,Stories of adventure and heroes!,"Knowledge is a reliable weapon. Sadly, most people just leave it gathering dust on their shelves.","Looks like you enjoy throwing yourself into unpredictable situations. But hey, that’s what heroes do, isn’t it?",,,,,10
387,2090,2,"Is corruption a sin in your eyes, or is it simply a choice of freedom?",Corruption is a sin with no turning back.,Corruption is simply another form of freedom.,"Heh… In my view, the true sin might be refusing to face one’s own desires and choices, wouldn’t you agree?","Freedom, that sense of being unbound, often leads to losing control. And I… have always reveled in that feeling of losing control…",,,,,10
388,2090,3,Human loyalty is often… more unreliable than the lies of demons. Would you betray me?,Never!,Perhaps… I’m not sure.,Is that so?

390,2090,1,"The angels see themselves as embodiments of light, but sometimes they can be more ruthless than us in the face of enemies… What is your view of them?",They are just hypocrites.,They are the true saints.,"Indeed, the boundary between light and darkness has always been defined by power.

392,2090,5,"Sometimes, I just want to lie in bed all day… Would you join me in being lazy?","Of course, it’s a kind of indulgence.",Uh… perhaps a bit boring.,"Who wouldn’t want to escape the gods’ endless wars?

408,2093,5,I see boys yelling the names of the girls they love at the sea. What do you think of that?,At least they trust the sea.,Wouldn't it be better to confess their love directly?,"Yeah, the sea wouldn't tell their secret to anyone, would it?","Unfortunately, such bravery is a rarity whatever era you're in. Especially those who dare to say it in front of me.",,,,,10
409,2093,2,I don't like The Little Mermaid.
